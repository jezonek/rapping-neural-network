For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo-Fanques Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
'ving been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Yeah-yeah-yeah..
Yeaahhh, yeah-yeah-yeah..
Coming down fast, but I'm miles above you..
Yeaahhh..
Tell me, tell me, tell me, c'mon, tell me the answer..
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
Yeaahhh...
Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love

There's nothing you can do that can't be done,
nothing you can sing that can't be sung,
nothing you can say ...
But you can learn how to play the game, 
it's easy.
Nothing you can make that can't be made,
no one you can save that can't be saved,
nothing you can do ...
But you can learn how to be you in time, 
it's easy.
All you need is love,

all you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.
(Love, Love, Love

All you need is love,

Love is all you need.
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
nothing you can see that isn't shown,
nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be,
it's easy.
All you need is love,
all you need is love,
all you need is love, love.
Love is all you need.
All you need is love, 
all you need is love, 
all you need is love, love.
Love is all you need,
Yeeah!
Yesterday.
Oh yeah!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
she loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Love is all you need.
Sunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up and has left you with no warning
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this, my love is up and must be leaving
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So, I must be on my way
And face another day
Now the darkness only stays the night-time
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good at arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Close your eyes and I'll kiss you

I'm findin' out what love is all about
And every day, at three, when school lets out
I see my baby I get weak in the knees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
My pappy told me there'll be times like these
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to Rockin' Joe's
The cats are stomping on their heels and toes
I grab my baby, trying to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Well, why must she be such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spends my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and the sun will shine
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
She spends my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for her kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and the sun will shine
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
They're gonna put me in the movies 
They're gonna make a big star out of me 
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely 
And all I gotta so is act naturally 
Well, I'll bet you, I'm gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can never tell 
The movies gonna make me a big star 
Cause I can play the part so well 
Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies 
Then I know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally 
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely 
And beggin down upon his bended knee 
I'll play the part but I won't need rehearsal 
All I have to do is act naturally 
Well, I'll bet you, I'm gonna be a big star 
Might win an Oscar you can never tell 
The movies gonna make me a big star 
Cause I can play the part so well 
Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies 
Then I know that you will plainly see 
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time 
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe 
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe 
Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world 
Sounds of laughter shades of earth are ringing through my opened ears
Inciting and inviting me 
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe 
Jai guru deva om 
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai guru deva, Jai guru deva, Jai guru deva...
You never give me your money 
You only give me your funny paper 
and in the middle of negotiations 
you break down 
I never give you my number 
I only give you my situation 
and in the middle of investigation 
I break down 
Out of college, money spent 
See no future, pay no rent 
All the money's gone, nowhere to go 
Any jobber got the sack 
Monday morning, turning back 
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go 
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go 
Oh, that magic feeling 
Nowhere to go 
One sweet dream 
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine 
Soon we'll be away from here 
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away 
One sweet dream came true today 
Came true today 
Came true today (yes it did) 
One two three four five six seven, 
All good children go to Heaven
Here comes the sun king 
Here comes the sun king 
Everybody's laughing 
Everybody's happy 
Here comes the sun king 
Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chica ferdy parasol

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park 
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper 
Sleeps in a hole in the road 
Saving up to buy some clothes 
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose 
Such a mean old man 
Such a mean old man 
His sister Pam works in a shop 
She never stops, she's a go-getter 
Takes him out to look at the queen 
Only place that he's ever been 
Always shouts out something obscene 
Such a dirty old man 
Dirty old man
Well you should see Polythene Pam 
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man 
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag 
Yes you should see Polythene Pam. 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt 
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World" 
Yes you could say she was attractively built. 
Yeah yeah yeah
She came in through the bathroom window 
Protected by a silver spoon 
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
By the banks of her own lagoon 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
She said she'd always been a dancer 
She worked at 15 clubs a day 
And though she thought I knew the answer 
Well I knew what I could not say. 
And so I quit the police department 
And got myself a steady job 
And though she tried her best to help me 
She could steal but she could not rob 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh yeah
Once there was a way to get back homeward 
Once there was a way to get back home 
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
And I will sing a lullaby 
Golden slumbers fill your eyes 
Smiles awake you when you rise 
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
And I will sing a lullaby 
Once there was a way to get back homeward 
Once there was a way to get back home 
Sleep pretty darling do not cry 
And I will sing a lullaby
Boy, you gotta carry that weight 
Carry that weight a long time 
Boy, you gotta carry that weight 
Carry that weight a long time 
I never give you my pillow 
I only send you my invitation 
And in the middle of the celebrations 
I break down 
Boy, you gotta carry that weight 
Carry that weight a long time 
Boy, you gotta carry that weight 
Carry that weight a long time
Oh yeah, all right 
Are you going to be in my dreams 
Tonight? 
Love you x25
And in the end 
The love you take 
Is equal to the love you make.
For I have got another girl, another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl, another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you "this time you'd better stop" 
For I have got another girl
Another girl who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend
I don't want to say that I've been unhappy with you
But as from today, well, I've seen somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want

I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl
Another girl
If you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighin
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
"Cos they know I got my one and only
They'd be glad that you're not bad to me
They'd be glas that you're not bad to me, to me, to me
A bad little kid moved in to my neighbourhood
He won't do nothing right, just a-sittin’ got to look so good
He don't wanna go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays that rock and roll music all night
Well, he put thumb-tacks on teacher's chair
Put chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, Junior, behave yourself!
Buys every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets, oh, he's off to the jukebox man
Well, he worries that teacher till at night she's a-ready to poop
From rockin’ and a rollin’, spinnin’ in a hula-hoop
Well, his rock and roll has gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, Junior, behave yourself, Ah!
Gonna tell ya mamma, you'd better do what she said:
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
You shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbour's cat
You gave the cocker-spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, ya mamma said it's gotta stop
Junior's head is hard as a rock
Now, Junior, behave yourself!
Ooo!
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black
And I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black
And I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim
She thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do
Baby's in black
And I'm feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do
Baby's in black

Tell me oh what can I do
She thinks of him
And so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back
She's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black
And I'm feeling blue
Tell me oh what can I do?
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Now that you know who you are
What do you want to be
And have you traveled very far
Far as the eye can see?
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
How often have you been there?
Often enough to know
What did you see when you were there
Nothing that doesn't show
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
How does it feel to be one of the beautiful people
Turned to a natural E, happy to be that way?
Now that you've found another key
What are you going to play?
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too
You keep all your money in a big brown bag inside a zoo
What a thing to do
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man
Baby you're a rich man too.
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby baby.
Baby, baby baby, b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby, baby.
Baby baby baby
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you.
Well, you may go to college,
You may go to school.
You may have a pink cadillac,
But don't you be nobody's fool.
Now baby,
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby,
I wanna play house with you.
Now listen and I'll tell you baby

So we can play some house.
Now baby,
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby,
I wanna play house with you.
Oh let's play house, baby.
Now this is one thing, baby
That I want you to know.
Come on back and let's play a little house,
And we can act like we did before.
Well, baby,
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby,
I wanna play house with you.
Yeah.
Now listen to me, baby
Try to understand.
I'd rather see you dead, little girl,
Than to be with another man.
Now baby,
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby, come.
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you.
Oh, baby baby baby.
Baby baby baby b-b-b-b-b-b baby baby baby.
Baby baby baby.
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you.
Each day just goes so fast
I turn around, it's past
You don't get time to hang a sign on me
Love me while you can
Before I'm a dead old man
A lifetime is so short
A new one can't be bought
But what you've got means such a lot to me
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
Make love all day long
Make love singing songs
There's people standing round
Who'll screw you in the ground
They'll fill you in with all their sins, you'll see
I'll make love to you
If you want me to
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go,
I would hate my disappointment to show,
There's nothing for me here so I will disappear,
If she turns up while I'm gone please let me know.
I've had a drink or two and I don't care,
There's no fun in what I do if she's not there,
I wonder what went wrong I've waited far too long,
I think I'll take a walk and look for her.
Though tonight she's made me sad,
I still love her,
If I find her I'll be glad,
I still love her.
I don't want to spoil the party so I'll go,

I call your name, but you're not there
Was I to blame for being unfair?
Oh, I can't sleep at night
Since you've been gone
I never weep at night
I can't go on
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not that kind of man
Oh I can't sleep at night
But just the same
I never weep at night
I call your name. Ah!
Don't you know I can't take it?
I don't know who can
I'm not gonna make it

What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
The other day I saw you
As I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you
I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
I met you in the morning
waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning
I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no on else
But you were just the same
You didn't even think of me
As someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind
In your mind
In your mind
Try to see it my way, 
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on? 
While you see it your way, 
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone. 
We can work it out, 
We can work it out. 
Think of what you're saying. 
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright. 
Think of what I'm saying, 
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night. 
We can work it out, 
We can work it out. 
Life is very short, and there's no time 
For fussing and fighting, my friend. 
I have always thought that it's a crime, 
So I will ask you once again. 
Try to see it my way, 
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. 
While you see it your way 
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long. 
We can work it out, 
We can work it out.

Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the sun to shine
Hand my umbrella, with this dirt I wish she was mine
Everybody doves, think a thing; it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watchin' rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standin' in the garden, waitin' for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Lookin' at the bench of next door neighbours
Cryin' to my mom, I'm tryin' to set sabors
Everybody's got to have something hard to grow
Well, instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son, and make you one
You gotta get out son, and make you run
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry, though
Shoot big! 
Shoot big! 
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big! 
You gotta shoot big! 
Until you shoot big
I can't stand
It’s been a long time, now I’m coming back home, 
I’ve been away now, oh how I’ve been alone
Wait till I come back to your side, 
We’ll forget the tears we cried. 
But if your heart breaks, don’t wait, turn me away, 
And if your heart’s strong, hold on, I won’t delay
Wait till I come back to your side, 
We’ll forget the tears we cried. 
I feel as though you ought to know 
That I’ve been good, as good as I can be, 
And if you do, I’ll trust in you, 
And know that you will wait for me. 
It’s been a long time, now I’m coming back home, 
I’ve been away now, oh how I’ve been alone
Wait till I come back to your side, 
We’ll forget the tears we cried.

I’ve been away now, oh how I’ve been alone

Two of us riding nowhere 
Spending someone's 
Hard earned pay 
You and me Sunday driving 
Not arriving 
On our way back home 
We're on our way home 
We're on our way home 
We're going home 
Two of us sending postcards 
Writing letters 
On my wall 
You and me burning matches 
Lifting latches 
On our way back home 
We're on our way home 
We're on our way home 
We're going home 
You and I have memories 
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead 
Two of us wearing raincoats 
Standing solo
In the sun 
You and me chasing paper 
Getting nowhere 
On our way back home 
We're on our way home 
We're on our way home 
We're going home 
You and I have memories 
Longer than the road that stretches out ahead 
Two of us wearing raincoats 
Standing solo
In the sun 
You and me chasing paper 
Getting nowhere 
On our way back home 
We're on our way home 
We're on our way home 
We're going home 
We're going home 
Better believe it
Good bye

Running to and fro, hard-working at the mill
Never fails in the mail, yeah, comes a rotten bill
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again
Salesman talking to me, trying to run me up a creek
Say, "you can buy, go one and try, you can pay me next week"
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again
Long-haired, good-looking, trying to get me hooked
Wants me to marry, settle down, get a home, write a book, ah!
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again
Been to Yokohama, been a-fighting in the war
Army bunk, army go, army chow, army clothes
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again
Same thing, every day, getting up, going to school
No need of me complaining, my objections over-ruled
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business for me to involve again
Working in the filling station, too many tasks
Wipe the windows, check the tires, check the oil, the dollar gas, ah!
Too much monkey business
Too much monkey business
Don't want your botheration, get away, leave me!
Turn off your mind, relax and float down stream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone,
It is knowing, it is knowing
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams,
It is not living, it is not living,
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning
Of the beginning
Of the beginning

There were bells 
On a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds 
In the sky
But I never saw them winging
No I never saw them at all
Till there was you

And wonderful roses
They tell me 
In sweet fragrant meadows 
Of dawn and dew
There was love 
All around
But I never heard it singing
No I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music 
And wonderful roses
They tell me 
In sweet fragrant meadows 
Of dawn and dew
There was love 
All around

Three cool cats
Three cool cats
A-hung up on a corner in a beat up car
Splitting up a nip of candy bar
Talking on about how sharp they are
Three cool cats
Three cool chicks
Are walking down the street
Swinging their hips
Splitting up a bag of potato chips
And three cool cats did three big flips for
Three cool chicks
Yeah three cool chicks
Well up popped that first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well, I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey, man, save one chick for me"
Hey, well three cool chicks
Three cool chicks
Well they looked like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks made three fools out of 
Those three cool cats
Three cool cats
Well up popped that first cool cat
He said, "Man, look at that!
Man, do you see what I see?"
"Well, I want that middle chick"
"I want that little chick"
"Hey, man, save one chick for me"
Three cool chicks
Three cool chicks
Well they looked like angels from up above
And three cool cats really fell in love
But three cool chicks made three fools out of 
Those three cool cats

Three cool cats, oh three cool cats.
That boy took my love away
Oh, he'll regret it some day
But this boy wants you back again
That boy isn't good for you
Though he may want you too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh, my, oh
That boy won't be happy
till he's seen you cry
This boy wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy...
I've got a word or two 
To say about the things that you do 
You're telling all those lies 
About the good things that we can have 
If we close our eyes 
Do what you want to do 
And go where you're going to 
Think for yourself 
'Cause I won't be there with you 
I left you far behind 
The ruins of the life that you had in mind 
And though you still can't see 
I know your mind's made up 
You're gonna cause more misery 
Do what you want to do 
And go where you're going to 
Think for yourself 
'Cause I won't be there with you 
Although your mind's opaque 
Try thinking more if just for your own sake 
The future still looks good 
And you've got time to rectify 
All the things that you should 
Do what you want to do 
And go where you're going to 
Think for yourself 
'Cause I won't be there with you 
Do what you want to do 
And go where you're going to 
Think for yourself 
'Cause I won't be there with you 
Think for yourself 
'Cause I won't be there with you
You say you will love me
If I have to go
You'll be thinking of me
Somehow I will know
Someday when I'm lonely
Wishing you weren't so far away
Then I will remember
Things we said today
You say you'll be mine, girl
'Til the end of time
These days, such a kind girl
Seems so hard to find
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just a lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today
Me, I'm just a lucky kind
Love to hear you say that love is luck
And, though we may be blind
Love is here to stay. And that's enough
To make you mine, girl
Be the only one
Love me all the time, girl
We'll go on and on
Someday when we're dreaming
Deep in love, not a lot to say
Then we will remember
Things we said today.
"There's a Place"
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time 
When I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so?
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time 
When I'm alone
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
In the beginning I misunderstood
But now I've got it, the word is good
Spread the word and you'll be free
Spread the word and be like me 
Spread the word I'm thinking of 
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Everywhere I go I hear it said
In the good and the bad books that I have read
Say the word and you'll be free
Say the word and be like me 
Say the word I'm thinking of
Have you heard the word is love?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Now that I know what I feel must be right
I'm here to show everybody the light
Give the word a chance to say
That the word is just the way
It's the word I'm thinking of
And the only word is love
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Say the word, love (x4)

We said our goodbye, ah, the night before
Love was in your eyes, ah, the night before
Now today I find you have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies, ah, the night before? 
Was I so unwise, ah, the night before? 
When I held you near you were so sincere
A-treat me like you did the night before
Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did it makes me wanna cry

The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me standing here
A long long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here
Lead me to your door
Without going out of my door
I can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
I could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of my door
You can know all things of earth
With out looking out of my window
You could know the ways of heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doing
For goodness sake

Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun 
In case of accidents he always took his mom 
He's the all American bullet-headed Saxon mother's son 
All the children sing 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies 
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise 
So Captain Marval zapped him right between the eyes 
All the children sing 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin 
"Not when he looked so fierce" his mommy butted in 
If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him 
All the children sing 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill 
Hey Bungalow Bill

Standing in the dock at Southampton, 
Trying to get to Holland or France. 
The man in the mac said, "You've got to go back". 
You know they didn't even give us a chance. 
Christ you know it ain't easy, 
You know how hard it can be. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me. 
Finally made the plane into Paris, 
Honey mooning down by the Seine. 
Peter Brown called to say, 
"You can make it O.K., 
You can get married in Gibraltar, near Spain". 
Christ you know it ain't easy, 
You know how hard it can be. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me. 
Drove from Paris to the Amsterdam Hilton, 
Talking in our beds for a week. 
The newspapers said, "Say what you doing in bed?" 
I said, "We're only trying to get us some peace". 
Christ you know it ain't easy, 
You know how hard it can be. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me. 
Saving up your money for a rainy day, 
Giving all your clothes to charity. 
Last night the wife said, 
"Oh boy, when you're dead 
You don't take nothing with you 
But your soul - think!" 
Made a lightning trip to Vienna, 
eating chocolate cake in a bag. 
The newspapers said, "She's gone to his head, 
They look just like two gurus in drag". 
Christ you know it ain't easy, 
You know how hard it can be. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me. 
Caught an early plane back to London. 
Fifty acorns tied in a sack. 
The men from the press said, "We wish you success, 
It's good to have the both of you back". 
Christ you know it ain't easy, 
You know how hard it can be. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me. 
The way things are going 
They're going to crucify me.

A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine 
and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, 
that means a lot
A friend says a love is never true
And you know that this don't apply to you
A touch can mean so much 
when it's all you've got
When she says she loves you 
that means a lot
Love can be deep inside
love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide 
what you feel when it's real
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know your love is all you've got
At touch can mean so much
when it's all you've got
When she says she loves you 
that means a lot
Can't you see, yeah, 
can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah, 
can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah,

My body check turns your body to a bloody wreck
You and your girlfriends yeah your buddy's next
Blood thirsty I stalk with the full clip
Walk my dog after dark when the moons lit
I follow footprints equipped with a tool kit
Its clockwork when my mood shift is Kubrick
I pump a fool with a lethal dosage watch their eyeballs pop out like harlequin ichtyosis
Try to trespass my yard full of deadly Dobers
I wash the blood from their fur with some head and shoulders
Cold case no trace come through
Chopping off heads with the machete crew
Way too hard for the hit list
So I take down the stars on my shit-list
Vicious
Ciao Bella it’s the English-Dutch fella

Join the adventure we out for the treasure
Heads get severed its all my pleasure
Its doomsday so we melt down the cheddar
You know Dopey Rotten as the nutty professor
Never will I give up I will be here forever
Chop you up body parts in the blender
Never surrender I always remember
Gone til November you'll find me in Denver
Big up Maurizio it's a joint venture
You get dismembered no first time offenders
Your world of pain has just ended
No you won't survive because your chances are slender
Toc, toc, sono io, il tuo incubo peggiore
Billy The Kid del beat
Lirico squarciagole
Sono il king come Nat Cole
Finchè lo ripeto ti convinci che ho ragione
Dovrei aprirti gli occhi ma sei nato verme
Invertebrato inerme
La tua vita è finta dietro sembra che hai lo sfondo verde
Bella questa festa di merda
E la tua testa è un paracadute
E se non te la apro a che serve?
Dovrei cercare un alibi
La vita cambia in fretta esattamente come cambio gli abiti
Non ti fidar di me qualsiasi cosa capiti
Perché chi va con lo zoppo parcheggia al posto dei disabili
Dio mi parla nel sonno dice dividi le masse
Chiede se i politici pagano mai le tasse
Per lo show chiama 3 volte 6
Per il flow non serve translate
Shake, shake, shake your blood

Wrap a lizard in gauze beat you in the jaws with it
Grab the scissors and saws and
Cut out your livers gizzards and balls
Throw you in the middle of the ocean in the blizzard with jaws

Brian: The next few minutes are in the lap of the gods and hands of the
Beatles. In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and they...
Paul: Yes.
Brian: Now they...
John: Hey, listen.
Paul: It's all changed now.
John: It's all changed now.
Brian: Well this is what I'm wondering:
Paul: We're not doing that. No actors.
John: All now...
Brian: In those days the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor. Did you find that?
John: No, no, no. These are the good bits in the film, that's certainly the best.
Brian: Yes.
John: Rubish.
Brian: Was it really?
John: Even worse.
Brian: Who was worse?
John: Oh, Paul.
Brian: I see.
Paul: I think John was rather worse.
John: No, It was you.
Paul: Oh, RIngo was very good.
Brian: He was?

Where we can jump and shout. 
It's not too far back on the highway
Not too long a ride.

And you park it outside.

And you can thank her, ma'am, 
'Cos every time you're gonna drive,
You find the joint is jammed.

Steal your heart away.

While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd. 
Well you can dance

Is there anybody going to listen to my story 
All about the girl who came to stay? 
She's the kind of girl you want so much 
It makes you sorry 
Still, you don't regret a single day. 
Ah girl! Girl! 
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her 
She will turn to me and start to cry 
And she promises the earth to me 
And I believe her. 
After all this time I don't know why. 
Ah, girl! Girl! 
She's the kind of girl who puts you down when friends are there, 
You feel a fool. 
When you say she's looking good, she acts as if it's understood. 
She's cool ooo-oh, ooo-oh, ooo-oh, Girl! Girl! 
Was she told when she was young that pain 
Would lead to pleasure? 
Did she understand it when they said 
That a man must break his back to earn 
His day of leisure? 
Will she still believe it when he's dead? 
Ah girl! Girl! Girl!
Can't buy me love, love 
Can't buy me love 
I'll buy you a diamond ring my friend 
If it makes you feel alright 
I'll get you anything my friend 
If it makes you feel alright 
'Cause I don't care too much for money, 
Money can't buy me love 
I'll give you all I got to give 
If you say you love me too 
I may not have a lot to give 
But what I got I'll give to you 
I don't care too much for money, 
Money can't buy me love 
Can't buy me love, 
Everybody tells me so 
Can't buy me love, 
No no no, no 
Say you don't need no diamond ring 
And I'll be satisfied 
Tell me that you want the kind of thing 
That money just can't buy 
I don't care too much for money, 
Money can't buy me love, ahh

Everybody tells me so

And I'll be satisfied 
Tell me that you want the kind of thing 
That money just can't buy

Beautiful Dreamer, wake unto me,
Starlight and dewdrops are waiting for thee;
Sounds of the rude world heard in the day,
Lull'd by the moonlight have all pass'd away!
Beautiful dreamer, queen of my song,
List while I woo thee with soft melody;
Gone are the cares of life's busy throng
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, out on the sea,
Mermaids are chaunting the wild lorelie;
Over the streamlet vapors are borne,
Waiting to fade at the bright coming morn.
Beautiful dreamer, beam on my heart,
E'en as the morn on the streamlet and sea;
Then will all clouds of sorrow depart,
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!
Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me!

My baby doll, my baby doll, my baby doll.
I'm thnking about the times you drove in my car
I'm thinking that I might have drove you too far
And I'm thinking of the love that you laid on my table.
I told you not to wander 'round in the dark
I told you 'bout the swans that they live in the park
Then I told you 'bout our kid' now he's married to Mabel.
Yes I told you that the life goes up and down
Notice how the wheel goes around
And you'd better pick yourself up from the ground
Before they bring the curtain down,
Yes, before they bring the curtain down.
Talking about a girl that looks quite like you
She didn't have the time to wait in the queue
She cried away her life since she fell out cradle.
-What's the Achozen?-
Deuces is wild this is pitty pat
2-2 with the triple fat goose.
You! You aint ever placed a bigger bet,
You! You aint never seen a bigger threat.
Deuces is wild getting willy off a bag of ily
Iced out on the sand like a chilly willy
You! You aint ever placed a bigger bet
Deuces is wild, it's a triple threat.
In the world that's been frozen
They come be Achozen
Rise up from the dead
Overthrow the erosion
Forces of evil controlling our people
Deuces is wild and their wisdom is lethal
4:22 stop it through I can see you
Strike a match light the sun
Watch the preview
Life is a game
Played once dogg reviewed two
3 is the view and the life we are true to
Deuces is wild this is pitty pat
2-2 with the triple fat goose
You! You aint ever placed a bigger bet
You! You Aint never seen a bigger threat.
This is how I really talk
FUCK what you really thought
Now I'm really pop
Shit talk silly pot
Id like to kill the cat
Ice like the polar caps
Jawra is ily raw
So fast you kill my rap
Your phantom power,
My anthem will strike the power
The truths that which are right
And which will be sanctum power
This is how I spit
My night
To this very time
An hour with disrespect
A light we shine
-What's the Achozen?
-What's the Achozen?-
Deuces is wild this is pitty pat
Deuces is wild this is pitty pat
In the world that's been frozen
They come be Achozen
Rise up from the dead 
Overthrow the erosion
Forces of evil controlling our people
Deuces are wild and their wisdom is lethal.
Newer force I can see right through you
We Achozen, we come here to free you
So you can live in this world like we do
Achozen few, former outcast people
Deuces is wild this is pitty pat
2-2 with the triple fat goose
You! You aint ever placed a bigger bet
You! You aint never seen a bigger threat
Deuces is wild getting willy off a bag of ily
Iced out on the sand like a chilly willy
You! You aint ever placed a bigger bet
Deuces is wild it's a triple threat.
Deuces is, Deuces is, Deuces is, Deuces is..
GRUBSON:
Boom-Paaał!!! Poszła rakieta, widać z daleka
Pędzi czarny wóz, nie Corvetta
"Zaciesza!" Cała ta załoga busa
"Ausa!" Nie widzisz nas, a my tuż za
Zakrętem, parchatą widać gębę, o Jezu!
"Kto Ty jesteś?!" Watashi wa GrubSon desu "uuu!"
Gruby Brzuch plus Bu, daj na luz tu
Dupę rusz tu, włóż tu wusztu do rusztu
Jest old school, new school, true school
Nie kusku - kusku w łóżku po uszku
Przy pomocy paluszków
"Czyj to bit brat, czyj?!"
Nie wiesz to ry-ry-ry-ry-ry-ry-ry- RYJ!
Z najdalszych świata zakątków ludzie są tu
Bez kłopotów, wątów, podpięli się do prądu 
I tak, każdy z nich i każdy z nas
3ODZI tu dziś i jak dzik zaciesza
Dobra...Jeżeli gotowy jesteś macho, to dawaj znać, bo
Ludzie czekają całe lata tu na to, a to
Łupie w kręgosłupie, super bawi twoją grupę
Tu gdzie mamy dobrą nutę, zacieszamy "hadouken!"
Cała horda - z nami zaciesza!
Każda morda - z nami zaciesza!
Każdy z Was - z nami zaciesza!
Jak mówi nasza brać - chodź z nami zacieszać!
Czy miasto, czy wioska - z nami zaciesza!
Cała Polska - z nami zaciesza!
Cały świat - z nami zaciesza!
Jak mówi nasza brać - chodź z nami zacieszać!
BRK: 
Buja się tancbuda, buja się cały kraj
Ty jak masz wielkie jaja, chodź i z nami zacieszaj
Dzisiaj wódy z piwem ziombel lepiej nie mieszaj
Jak masz ze sobą bata, to go szybko odpalaj
Heej! Wchodzimy do klubu moonwalk'iem
zacieszamy tak, że wypada kit z okien
Możesz się przyłączyć, jak nie to rzuć okiem
Lepiej idź do domu jak jesteś obibokiem
O nie ! Bas gniecie jak lawina
Nie mów, że masz dość, to dopiero się zaczyna
Jak dostaniesz w kość, wiedz, że to nie nasza wina
Dzisiaj jest nas tylu, ile jest ryżu w Chinach
Gruby brzuch i Bu zdzieramy papę z dachu
Kiedy wchodzimy na scenę, to z daleka od strachu
Powstań siostro i powstań brachu
Do boju! Wszystkie parchy do ataku!!
Cała horda - z nami zaciesza!
Każda morda - z nami zaciesza!
Każdy z Was - z nami zaciesza!
Jak mówi nasza brać - chodź z nami zacieszać!
Czy miasto czy wioska - z nami zaciesza!
Cała Polska - z nami zaciesza!
Cały świat - z nami zaciesza!
Jak mówi nasza brać - chodź z nami zacieszać!
BU:
Ku hecy, ogółu leci bit stuleci
Z tego tytułu nawet typ na wózku nie usiedzi
Uprzedzić chcę, że to smutnego uleczy
Więc się nie zachowuj jak obsmarkany królewicz
Bu dziedzic patentów na rozrywkę w cipę
Wychodzę z zakrętu jak bolidem lider
Obstawą Gruby brzuch, kto gitem widzę
U podstaw poruszy klub, nie bądź cyber-widzem
Podziwiaj weekend, zaczynamy od czwartku
Do środy hat-trick'iem, zapisany arkusz
Fajrantu czas na wajzlu, na wieszaku fartuch
Gna bus z hot shit'em dla relaksu w kraj znów
Weź nie maskuj intruza dziś butlą Kubusia
Skoro jak husarz do tanku z wiśniówką tu ruszam
Zacieszamy na luzach, zakończymy na domówce
Opróżnimy lodówkę i zostawimy kac kupkę, Bu!
Cuty: Jak tu pięknie pachnie...poezja...jadą chłopcy z tym gównem...faya..
do prawdy?...nie, do dupy...jest w tym jednak coś nieodparcie wulgarnego...
For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline 
The Hendersons will all be there 
Late of Pablo Fanques Fair-what a scene 
Over men and horses hoops and garters 
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire! 
In this way Mr. K. will challenge the world! 
The celebrated Mr. K. 
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishop's Gate 
The Hendersons will dance and sing 
As Mr. Kite flys through the ring don't be late 
Messrs. K and H. assure the public 
Their production will be second to none 
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz! 
The band begins at ten to six 
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound 
And Mr. H. will demonstrate 
Ten summersets he'll undertake on solid ground 
Having been some days in preparation 
A splendid time is guaranteed for all 
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill.
Here's the latest
from the king of badness
I got the shit that makes niggaz wanna flip
G'd up all better wit beanies
Sweatin all the bitches to blow are weanies
Niggaz all getting drunk, and smoking a bum bud
Oh wait here's a punk, pump the trunk
Cuz it's a gang of jackers in the front smoking
all the hump, some shit was said about blue and red
but I'm colour blind and I gotta nine
threw up the sign I cock the 9, I cock the 9.
Well nigga pop the 9and let it holla
Test drive wit a neighbourhood's scholar
Black Impaler, blue chucks on gettin outta
Sucks on hip hop thugsta get the fuck on
Niggaz looking shifty, do they wanna diss me, lick me
Show me love or peel my cap quickly
My six sense won't let me slip don't puff wit the draggin em
I'm still toe taggin em, hit the spot wit a don still baggin em
It's the low call, S.A.B on the vocal, blast my way out eazy pay
The way, all you bitch niggaz stay out
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 ( and everything is fine)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (*gun shot*)
I cock the 9, I cock the 9, I cock the 9 (my homey pop the 9)
It's like dice game, dice game niggaz get they roll'on
Everything's all good till niggaz getting sold on
Here we all get together and shoot, fuck
I grab my gun then I picked up my loot
But I didn't lose shit so it's all good
Leavin pumpin Eazy-E "Boyz n the Hood"
Cuz I'm a gangsta so I can relate, most of these
Niggaz is fake and tryin to hate
I put a buster in his place, I put one in his face
Obey my first and give him the taste
That's how I duz it, that's how I do it
and the murder weapon that I use you know I threw it
he kept persuading so I had to do it, 'uh' play
for keeps that's the rule of the streets 'uh'.
Dick Tracy all on my nuttz like Cagny and Lacy
And don't faze me, Ruthless is the label that pays me
But this one H.K weighs a ton, words are yellow wit
the ??? freaks on a run, bring ya condom in the kingdom
huh ho from the ceilin to the floor, info red at ya window
plus the E go hangin out the beamer tho
drop shit like a seagull, for the people
ho's make a contribution, but y'all don't hear me tho.
Tuck ya legs to my dick with the wrap em real tight
Just incase its on and a nigga gotta fight, an a
Nigga gotta bust, but who in the fuck said in god we trust
The shit wen't down everybody start runnin
Bitches screamin and the bullets still comin
Run into a nigga tryin to save mine, reach for my gun ahh shit!!
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see 
Dont listen to the rumours they say 50 f**kin' crazy 
50 dont know how to treat a lady 
Hey Girl, I like you a lot I dont wanna hurt you 
But I call a square a square and a circle a circle 
Ride by the beach, I call you a bitch then hang up 
Probably call you right back and shit 
And I have to say baby I apologize, cross my fingers God forgive me for 
tellin' lies 
Like Janet Jackson say "I miss you much, I really wanna feel your touch" 
As Bobby said "Baby I could pass the day, watchin' you model Lingerie" 
I wanna spend the night tonight shorty If its okay 
You can be my Beyonce I'll be your Jay 
I gotta great sense of humour, questions make ya smile then I whoo ya! 
You know how I do ya, or do ya? 
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see 
It's New York, to London, you wonderin' whats gonna be the next stop 
I told you, Im'a Don you goin' on ma'dam 
After you shop 'till your feet hurt in Malones 
Now take a picture these are moments you can cherrish 
They say the scene of me was made for lovers out in Paris 
The risers and the beleivers sayin' "50 we love you" 
But out there, theres no me so I love them 
You may not recognize this, the reason I exist 
Deliver best than the best so perfection I guess 
Just like I miss the stress, I'll pass the test 
Everytime I drop, Im burnin' hot 
I dont care If she loves me or loves me not 
As long as I enjoy the time that we spent 
I dont care, baby we could f**k and be friends 
Matter fact we can do it right in the back of my Benz 
You know its me... 
Follow my lead, baby I could be all you need, If you follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'll hold you down put your trust in me, baby follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I think God made you for me, follow my lead 
Follow my lead, I'm the one Girl in time you'll see
BITCH!!!

Creepn through this cloud of smoke
with a little bit of funk to make ya choke in
Gangstas come feel good inside
as we take you for a ride to another dimension
Deep from a 4-0 O-Z
Two crooked ass niggaz on a cosmic journey
Straight from the planet G
where the real niggaz dwell in the realms of Ruthless
Took a puff of the indo spliff
High like a bird as I creep to the bud spot
Break me off a proper piece so I can get fucked
with my nigga roachclip, BG Ashtray, dump that ash tray
Ruthless family, high as can be
Smoke that ?? psychadelically insane
and gettin higher than a motherfucker
As I step through the smoke
Deep from a land broke niggaz dont come to
Straight to Indonesia
Chronic fever step off punk we dont need ya
Blaze a blunt to the boogie
and come take a ride on a journey with a real G
life is easily explained on the level
of smokin bud with the motherfuckin Devil in my imagination
Sup with these thoughts what a fly creation
Indo smoke from the land of G'z
Letting them know they can't handle these
Niggaz, straight from the planet Dime
I have come to put funk on your mind
Eazy-E better known as Mr. Roach Clip
so pass the bud cuz we still gettin higher than a motherfucker
Now I'm real fucked up yes high as hell
Ring ding ding do I hear some bells
or am I just trippin
thinkin about that 4 that I'm dippin
Front, back, side to side
on corners that's how a nigga gotta ride
Dip to the, dip to the back
Bumpin' Eazy-E on 8 track
So blaze up a another skunky, funky, dookie, doobie,

Up some more, up, up it go

Maui-wowie, thai sticks, joints, roaches, indica,
concentrated rezi called hash or hashish;

and don't forget we still gettin higher than a motherfucker
Some call that a problem but I call it a gift
Xzibit make the whole continent shift (hell yeah)
Invadin your territory in a blaze of glory
A soldier story, livin off nothin but instinct
Bitch niggaz continue to floss and lip-sync
And I'ma just continue to flow, while rockin the boat
Probably smoke three-hundred thousand dollars in dope
Don't make my desert eagle barrel touch the back of your throat
Always approach niggaz that's known for killin your folks
Be surprised who could turn around and bust on y'all
Catch your mother or your sister comin out of the mall
Bang holes through they coats and they Macy bags
No retaliation you basically runnin with fags
In these streets, you only good as your last transaction
Funny style, and these niggaz ain't laughin
Y'all got it all fucked up in zero-zero
Think life is a video for "Last Action Heroes"
Face the price you pay for the games you play
When it's all said and done at the end of the day, you gotta
Get your walk on, get your head right
I know you feelin the shit, shit is dead right
Get your bounce on, back dat ass up
Bitch pass me the bottle, fill your glass up
Judge and jury, don't get your case dismissed
When I get pissed and smash through the makeshift
Uplift, dump this, make your shit knock
Hypnotical hardrock that don't flop
It's the best thing crackin my nigga
Lot of rappers talk of flashin the trigger but don't ever deliver
From the home of the toe tag, lowriders and body bags
earthquakes police with automatics and nerve gas
Learn fast or get left behind quick (yeah)
You testify, you get wrapped in plastic (hell yeah)
Xzibit turn your SUV into a casket
Melt your body parts in a tub full of sulfuric acid
Drastic measures we take just to get by
for all the shit you gotta go through to get high
Stand by, do or die for the West coast
Wanna fuck with Xzibit but can't come close motherfuckers
Tell y'all people to call my people
Recognize all men are not created equal
I'm lethal, all y'all faggots remain see-through
Only the kid from "The Sixth Sense" can peep you (DEAD PEOPLE!)
When I get through the world'll be a better place
A little Jesus Christ mixed with some Leatherface
Go find some punch to spike, find some dope to lace
Pull a pistol from my waist, nigga reach for space
Smack the taste out of your mouth if you talk shit
or hit so hard to the chin it make your back flip
My transcript number one up in this conference
It's nonsense, all y'all niggaz want is conflict
Only associate with pros and the convicts
Xzibit roll up in the spot with a bomb bitch
and then bounce with a couple, motherfuck a tussle
You never have enough muscle to stop a nigga hustle
Annotate Intro

Tell them to bring a bottle too

A room full of girls and we acting real rowdy
Your day breaks, your mind aches 
You find that all the words of kindness linger on 
When she no longer needs you 
She wakes up, she makes up 
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry 
She no longer needs you 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years! 
You want her, you need her 
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead 
You think she needs you 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years! 
You stay home, she goes out 
She says that long ago she knew someone but now he's gone 
She doesn't need him 
Your day breaks, your mind aches 
There will be times when all the things she said will fil your head 
You won't forget her 
And in her eyes you see nothing 
No sign of love behind the tears 
Cried for no one 
A love that should have lasted years!
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering. 
Where will it go?
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door 
And kept my mind from wandering.
Where will it go?
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong 
I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 
See the people standing there who disagree and never win 
And wonder why they don't get in my door. 
I'm painting my room in the colourful way 
And when my mind is wandering 
There I will go. 
And it really doesn't matter if 
I'm wrong I'm right 
Where I belong I'm right 
Where I belong. 
Silly people run around they worry me 
And never ask me why they don't get past my door. 
I'm taking the time for a number of things 
That weren't so important yesterday 
And I still go. 
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in 
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go.
Never know how much I love you
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Ev'rybody's got the fever
that is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night
Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with the flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn for sooth'
Captain Smith and Pocahantas
Had a very mad affair
When her daddy tried to kill him
She said 'Daddy, o, don't you dare
He gives me fever with his kisses
Fever when he holds me tight
Fever, I'm his misses
Oh daddy, won't you treat him right'
Now you've listened to my story
Here's the point that I have made
Chicks were born to give you fever
Be it Fahrenheit or centigrade
They give you fever when you kiss them
Fever if you live and learn
Fever till you sizzle
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
What a lovely way to burn
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.
Love has always been my game, play it how I may
I was made that way, can't help it.
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,
And if their wings burn, I know I'm not to blame
Falling in love again, I never wanted to
What am I to do, I can't help it.
Men cluster to me like moths around a flame,

When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes, I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes, I know that she loves me now
There is one thing I'm sure of
I will love her forever
For I know love will never die
Every little thing she does
She does for me, yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me, oooh

Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, picks up the rice
In the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face 
That she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie, writing the words
Of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks
In the night when there's nobody there
What does he care
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah look at all the lonely people
Ah look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby, died in the church
And was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie, wiping the dirt
From his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
I'm shouting all about love
While they treated you like a dog
When you were the one who had made it so clear
All those years ago
I'm talking all about how to give
They don't act with much honesty
But you point the way to the truth when you say
"All you need is love"
Living with good and bad
I always looked up to you
Now we're left cold and sad
By someone, the devil's best friend
Someone who offended all
We're living in a bad dream
They've forgotten all about mankind
And you were the one they backed up to the wall
All those years ago
You were the one who imagined it all
All those years ago.
Deep in the darkest night
I send out a prayer to you
Now in the world of light
Where the spirit free of lies
And all else that we despised
They've forgotten all about God
He's the only reason we exist
Yet you were the one that they said was so weird
All those years ago
You said it all though not many had ears
All those years ago
You had control of our smiles and our tears
All those years ago.
All those years ago ..
All those years ago ..
All those years ago ...
Day after day, alone on the hill,
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still.
But nobody wants to know him,
They can see that he's just a fool.
And he never gives an answer .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Well on the way, head in a cloud,
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud.
But nobody ever hears him,
Or the sound he appears to make.
And he never seems to notice .....
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
And nobody seems to like him,
They can tell what he wants to do.
And he never shows his feelings,
But the fool on the hill,
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
Oooooooooooooooh,
Round and round and round 
and round and round...
He never listens to them 
he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him 
The fool on the hill 
Sees the sun going down.
And the eyes in his head,
See the world spinning around.
I give her all my love 
That's all I do 
And if you saw my love 
You'd love her too 
I love her 
She gives me ev'rything 
And tenderly 
The kiss my lover brings 
She brings to me 
And I love her 
A love like ours 
Could never die 
As long as I 
Have you near me 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her 
Bright are the stars that shine 
Dark is the sky 
I know this love of mine 
Will never die 
And I love her

You never wear a stitch of lace
Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans 
except on sunday. 
So please don't ever change
no don't you ever change. 
I kind of like you 
just the way you are. 
You don't know the latest dance
but when it's time to make romance 
your kisses let me know 
you're not a tomboy. 
So please don't ever change
no don't you ever change. 
Promise you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are. 
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue. 
I love you when you're mad at me
so how can I get tired of you? 
A lots of other girls I've seen, 
they know how to treat guys mean. 
But you would rather die 
than ever hurt me. 
So please don't ever change
no don't you ever change. 
Just promise you're always gonna be
as sweet as you are. 
Please don't ever change
don't you ever change. 
Please don't ever change, 
don't you ever change.

Late yesterday night, I saw a light shine from a window,
and as I looked again, your face came into sight.
I couldn't walk on unil you'd gone from your window.
I had to make you mine, I knew you were the one.
Oh, I would be so glad just to have a love like that,
oh, I would be true and I'd live my life for you.
So meet me tonight, just where the light shines from a window,
and as I take your hand, say that you'll be mine tonight.

(Thank you, brothers
Me, me hand's getting, er, too cold to play the chords)
Trunk Muzik
Trunk Muzik
Burn One
Burn One
Straight from the back of the game I rock it
Yelawolf's got that crack boy
In the woods with the SK I'm cockin'
You don't want to play with that toy
Droppin' this heat like a asteroid
Good in the south like Pastor Troy
Pull up beside of a 1977
Sittin' back and sippin' my chronic 7
Pimpin' I'm about to get down
Look at me changin' lanes
Twin pipes lookin' like dragon's breath
Yes I know it's strange
Hit you with a left
I pull the chains
Bitch you too heavy to carry
You don't wanna bury yourself
Underneath that 808 I'll drop
It in your face like
To the DJs
Out cruisin'
I got that Trunk Muzik
Everybody hop in the Cadillac
And idle back on the throttle
And Chevrolets with the bottom
Won't you roll the window down
If you cruising
I got that Trunk Muzik
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf
On the 808 come in fade away
Ain’t no better way to get down
Told you I was coming
Said I'd be here in 5
And even though I brought you glasses
You still can't believe your eyes
But if you don't believe it by now
Fuck it just lean to the side
Hold up wait a minute I don't really
Wanna leave without a single solitary
So when needed for I'll bring it to em
If your sailin' catch my drift
Lead me to the door check my list
Meet me at the floor catch this fist
Or meet me at the store catch this lick
Build this house flip this brick
Real skateboarders feel this grip
Moving through the alleyway
Look at the people tripping
Cause I'm only chopping like
I have to be the hardest I got diamond nuts
I piss excellence Ricky Bobby lines 'em up
Catfish Billy half-pints 'em up
Yelawolf country fries 'em up
Put 'em in a duffle bag then I roll up in a river then I hold up
Watch what the fuck you hold up
Dynamite sticks will blow up
Ghet-O-Vision got this sold up
Roll up smoke up
Everybody wishin' they chose us
But we don't give a fuck you know what
I know you didn't see me coming but I'm coming anyway
Bitch Yelawolf is stylin' on you
I listen for your footsteps 
Coming up the drive 
Listen for your footsteps 
But they don't arrive 
Waiting for your knock dear 
On my old front door 
I don't hear it 
Does it mean you don't love me any more. 
I hear the clock a'ticking 
On the mantel shelf 
See the hands a'moving 
But I'm by myself 
I wonder where you are tonight 
And why I'm by myself 
I don't see you 
Does it mean you don't love me any more. 
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue 
'Cause you know darling I love only you 
You'll never know it hurt me so 
How I hate to see you go 
Don't pass me by don't make me cry 
I'm sorry that I doubted you 
I was so unfair 
You were in a car crash 
And you lost your hair 
You said you would be late 
About an hour or two 
I said that's alright I'm waiting here 
Just waiting to hear from you.
Yo, shout out to everybody that worked on the album, you feel me, son?
Yo, shouts out to Ty Dollas
Shouts out to Hodgy Daddies, shouts out to Left Brizzle
Shouts out to Domyen, shouts out to Frankie Ocean
Shouts out to Syd the Dude, shouts out to L-Boy Awwwwk
The big eared bandit is tossin' all his manners
In a bag and wrappin' them in Saran wrap bandages
Tossin' 'em in baskets with the rest of those sandwiches
So when he says "Catch up, nigga" it looks like an accident
Um, flowin' like my pad is the maxiest
My bitch white and black like she's been mimickin' a panda
It's the dark skinned nigga, kissin' bitches in Canada
Then kicking all out like Mr. Lawrence did Pamela
Put her in the chamber all against her Wilt Chamberlain
I never had a Reason, nigga I was just Ableton
Not a fuckin' Logic contradictin' dick head
Flyer than an ostrich moshin' in a tar pit
Semen scented cheetah printed tee
In that 'Preme five panel, I'll repeat it for the season
Previous items in the present
With the normal ass past like I cheated on my team
It's me (Tried to get that nigga, but, Golf Wang)
To have some type of knowledge that is one perception
But knowin' you own your opponent is a defeatin' bonus
I'm Zeus to a Kronos, cartilage cartridge is boneless
Smiles of cowards in lead showers, dead spouses in red blouses
Children who fled houses on Mustang horses and went joustin'
I'm on my Robin Hood shit, robbing in the hood
Whips, drugs, jewels, and your pet, I'm stealin' your rims
Coke diamonds and your Vette, soldiers lace the fuckin' boot
And salute like the troop when they shoot you gon' brrrooop
It's KillHodgy, nigga, stay the fuck off my stoop
And out my Kool aid, Juice
Hodgy got the juice, I got the gin
Jasper got the Henny, my nigga we get it in
Wolf Gang party at the hotel
I call a ho, you call a ho, and all the hoes tell
You know Left Brain need a freak
I need a bitch to go down like a Nitty beat
Yup, uh, and her ass fat
Don't be surprised if I ask where the hash at
Nigga I'm tryna smoke, bitch get higher
Domo where that Flocka Flame? Talking 'bout a lighter
Still bang salute me or just shoot me
Cause if you don't salute me then my team will do the shooting
Yeah my nigga Ace will pull the black jack
The king Mike G is in the cut with the black mac
We like the mafia, bitch, don't get to slacking up
And if these haters acting up, throw 'em in the aqueduct
Free my nigga Earl, yo, I don't really ask for much
But two bad bitches in front of me cunnilingus
What the fuck is caution?
Often I leave 'em flossing in KAWS, exes next to coffins
Lost in translation, the dreams you chase
Got you diving for the plates like you stealing home base
That's great, I'm home alone dreaming of two on ones
With Rihanna and Christina Milian, bring it on
And Travis is in the closet organizing and hanging the tramp
Three lettermans that Ace has been making him
No strays while we catching matinees, huh?
I'm getting blazed thinking 'bout those days
I had the top off the GT3 like toupees
One finger in the air
all's fair when crime pays
My grand scheme of things is to be attached
To the game like bitches to their wedding rings
And you don't even need to look cause we gleam obscene
In the light, ride slow to my yellow diamond shining
Like the Batman logo over Gotham, rock LA to Harlem
If you say "Get 'em Mike G" then I got 'em
One man squadron, nigga I'm a problem
From Briggs I got bars and plans to
Pimp these Polish bitches into pop stars
Humanity kills, we all suffer from insanity still
And if I said it then it is or it's gonna be real
OF 'til I OD and I probably will, uh
It's still Mr. Smoke-a-Lotta-Pot, get your baby mommy popped
With my other snobby bop, do I love her? Prolly not
Know your shit is not as hot as anything I fuckin' drop
Bitch I'm in the zone, stand alone, like Macaulay Cock
I've been runnin' blocks since a snotty tot
Big wheel was a big deal with the water Glocks
Now I'm all grown, same song, just a different waltz
Fire what I talk, but still cooler than an Otter Pop
Op, Dom next shit in your wish list
Mad sick shit, mad dick for your bitches
On some slick shit, your mistress on my hit list
And I'm lifted 'til I'm stiff outta this bitch
Odd in your mothafuckin' area
Blood clots give me five feet 'fore I bury ya
Suicide flow, let the big wave carry ya
Tyler got the mask like he held Jim Carrey up
And fuck your team, ho nigga wassup
Wolf Gang so you know we not giving no fucks
You know me dog, I'm a chill in the cut so I can
Cut it short, break it down, couple pounds, roll it up
Get me a Persian rug where the center looks like Galaga
Rent a super car for a day
Drive around with your friends, smoke a gram of that haze
Bro, easy on the ounce, that's a lot for a day
But just enough for a week, my nigga what can I say
I'm hi and I'm bye, wait I mean I'm straight
I'mma give you this wine, the runner just brought the grapes
My brother give it some time, Morris, and Day
Course you know the vibe's as fly as the rhymes
On the song, cut and you could sample the feel
Headphone bleed, make this shit sound real
Used to work the grill, Fatburger and fries
Then I made a mil and them psychics was liars
Now, how many fucking crystal balls can I buy and own
Humble old me had to flex for the folks
Down in Muscle Beach pumping iron and bone
Bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Yeah, bumping oldies off my cellular phone
Goddammit, this rapping is stupid and it's hard
Gotta do it over and over and over again but here it go
Hey it's Jasper, not even a rapper
Only on this beat to make my racks grow faster
Got a TV show, so I guess I'm an actor
Pot head, half baked, lookin' like Chappelle
Rollin' up a blunt with that fire from hell
Still ignorant, still hit a bitch
Wolf Gang, nigga, so I still don't give a shit
Catch me in the back with Miley on my lap
Bong rips as I feel on that little bitch cat
Hah, nigga came through with a 9 bar real quick
Just for the bitches, little bit of money in my pocket
Fuck it, Wolf Gang (Yeah, fuck that)
Look, for contrast, here's a pair of lips
Swallowin' Syrup and settin' fire to sheriff's whips
Crushin' rapper larynx to feed 'em a fuckin' carrot stick
And me? I just spent a year Ferrisin'
And lost a little sanity to show you what hysterics is
Spit til' the lips meet the bottom of a barrel, so that sterile piss
Flow remind these niggas where embarrassed is
Narrow, tight line, might impair him since
I made it back to Fahrenheit, grimey get dinero type
Feral, fuckin' ill apparel, wearin' pack of parasites
Threw his own youth off the roof after paradise
La di da di, back in here to fuck the party up
Raidin' fridges, tippin' over vases with a tommy gun
Never dollars, poppa make it rain hockey pucks
And 60 day chips from fuckin' awesome anonymous
Call him bloated 'til he show 'em that the flow deluxe
Off the wall loafers, Four Loko in a cobra clutch
Vocals bold and rough, evoke a ho to pose as drum
And let me hit and beat it with a stick until the hole is numb
The culprit of the potent punch
Scoldin' hot as dunkin' scrotum in a Folgers cup
Or Nevada, drivin' drunk inside a stolen truck
Shittin' like his colon bust
Belly full of chicken and a fifth of old petroleum
Supernova, I'm rollin' over the novices
And roamin' through the forest and spittin' cold as his porridge is
Stay gold 'til the case closed and the story end
Post mortem porkin' this rap shit and record it
To escort it to the morgue again, lord of lips
Bored of this, forklift the tippy top, best under 40 list
Stormin' the gate, ensurin' the bass
Scorchin', leave these motherfuckers sore in torso and face
Get at me, we savages, half a pack of Apache
Indian pack of niggas who don't give a fuck if we nasty as flatulence
As a matter of fact, your swagger is tacky
So see me you can't like Crunchy Black catchin' a taxi
Uh, back like lateral passin'
With that mothafuckin' gladiator manner of rappin'
As an addict I let Percocet and Xannies relax me
Fall back if your paddies is Maxi, please
OF, shit that's all I got
From my bigger brother Frankie to my little brother Tac
From that father figure Clancy to that skatey nigga Nak
Shreddin' down 'Fax, Wolf Gang run the fuckin' block
Storefront, knee tat
Book cover is the same lettering on lettermans and cotton socks
And grip tape...and my shoes
Um, I was 15 when I first drew that donut
5 years later, for our label yea we own it
I started an empire, I ain't even old enough
To drink a fucking beer, I'm tipsy off this soda pop
This is for the niggers in the suburbs
And the white kids with nigger friends who say the n-word
And the ones that got called weird, fag, bitch, nerd
Cause you was into jazz, kitty cats, and Steven Spielberg
They say we ain't actin' right
Always try to turn our fuckin' color into black and white
But they'll never change 'em, never understand 'em
Radical's my anthem, turn my fucking amps up
So instead of critiquing and bitchin', bein' mad as fuck
Just admit, not only are we talented, we're rad as fuck, bitches
"Yo man you here dat you here dat shit man"
Like what the fuck is this
Hey look at this what kinda luck is this
Only haters holler they can't feel us
Wanna get looser then we?
But just gonna be a looser to me and dilla(ha)
Killa, Talkin bout how you kill cops, you softer then a pillow
Backslapin' ya neck while you covered in rep?
cause you bluffin and you aint said nothin to spec?
Anyway i'm straight high off the trees
your girl don't wanna lie she's gonna get on a niggaz dick

While I'm singin', ma, do you let relieve you of all of your
Figure seating sketching, never believe in your niggaz (come on!)
Go head and babble you can watch me patiently waiting
Aimin', attackin', instead I'mma let one of my bitches slap you
I ain't watch you when your niggaz'll try
To feel a wrath of the un-rudely waking of a sleeping giant
And then I apply it and then your breathing is stop and totally quiet (sss.. oh)
Captain of this ship, so call me the pilot
I leave you and your crew to collide with me
Die, stomp on a nigga, just like a herd of a thousand cattle
That'll travel over your face and frazzle your shit
Shot you, worst than a brick and then be torturin' you
And then get the reverend, and get to steppin', nigga!

Turn the music up a little bit
Uh, yea
Lah-dah-daaah
A little bit louder . . right there
Dah-dah-daaah
Click click boo ya! Dub kicked the frame in (uh huh)
Nigga, let the games begin
As I stand in, tossed the tall can on a campus
Out the land of the scandalous, takin' penitentiary chances
Sick wit it, off the ric wit it
Blue beenie knitted; freshly acquitted
Grind-grimey, the big body and the big body
Wit lyrics and 'draulics hotter than the Mojave
Sellin', global bailin', career felon
Escalade, 3-braid beard wearin'
Fuck it, I thug for free and thug to eat
Niggas call me hog head 'cause I love the cheese
Gangstas, hustlas, pimps, if ya follow me
Let me see ya put them hands up like a robbery
I solemnly swear to stay down and slang the C
I spit in the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (Throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets
This is for them G niazz
Dub-S and my East niazz
Both side street niazz
This is for them DJ's coast to coast movin' this
Spin-ni-nin them turntables, that bomb Peruvian
Smashous, best trappers for cash and
Dumpin' blunt ashes outta them S-Classes
This is for them riders, ridin' for them M's
Ghetto ass niazz on them big shiny rims (uh huh)
Thrashin' ya, back at ya, bringin' it massive
I drop it on ya drastic, another hood classic
Dump the "Ghetto Heisman," seeing more cabbage
A street nia livin' on CEO status
Unlock the rack, Def Jam, cock it back
Recess is over, I want my spot back
Who's the next out the city to blow, coming at 'em
In a Pea coat and Stacy Adams, you're lookin' at 'em
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' stay fly (I'm gonna stay fly)
I'm gonna bust (I'm gonna bust)
Hold my hood up high (Throw my hood up high)
In the name of the streets
I'm gonna roll (I'm gonna roll)
I'm gon' rich ride (I'm goin' rich ride)
I'm gonna ball (I'm gonna ball)
Hold my hood up high
In the name of the streets
I told a woman I don't love her but she wants to go
I told another that I want her but she wants to ho
I ain't a hater, I'm a player so I fucked 'em both
In the name of the streets
Swangin' through a hood near you

While they sleepin on me, that's comatose

She fine as hell but she a mess girl
All I do is rhyme I got no time 
So I can't reply to yo text girl

You're very smart,
But won't you tell me how do you do it?

I never knew that a day 
like today lay before us. 
I've got the sun in my heart 
and my heart's in the sun. 
Skies are as bright 
as your eyes, 
the horizon is open.
Love is the ceiling, 
feelings are reelings 
free as the air. 
Forever on and forever,
forever on side by side. 
who ever knew that we two 
could be free as we'd fancy, 
fancy is free 
but are we bound 
to each other by love,
to each other by love? 
Who ever knew that we two

Hey Jude, don't make it bad,
take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her into your heart,
then you can start to make it better.
Hey Jude, don't be afraid,
you were made to go out and get her.
The minute you let her under your skin,
then you begin to make it better.
And anytime you feel the pain,
hey Jude, refrain,
don't carry the world upon your shoulder.
For well, you know that it's a fool
who plays it cool
by making his world a little colder.
Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na.
Hey Jude, don't let me down.
You have found her, now go and get her.
Remember to let her into your heart,
then you can start to make it better.
So let it out and let it in
hey Jude, begin, you're waiting for someone to perform with.
And don't you know that it's just you?
Hey Jude, you'll do, the movement you need is on your shoulder.
Na, na, na, na, na na, na, na. na.
Hey Jude, don't make it bad,
take a sad song and make it better.
Remember to let her under your skin,
then you begin to make it better, better, better, better, better, better, oh!
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, hey, Jude.
Sheepdog, standing in the rain 
Bullfrog, doing it again 
Some kind of happiness is 
Measured out in miles 
What makes you think you're 
Something special when you smile
Childlike no one understands
Jackknife in your sweaty hands 
Some kind of innocence is 
Measured out in years 
You don't know what it's like 
To listen to your fears
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
If you're lonely, you can talk to me 
Big man (yeah) walking in the park 
Wigwam frightened of the dark 
Some kind of solitude is 
Measured out in you 
You think you know me, but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
You can talk to me 
If you're lonely, you can talk to me
Hey Hey

Since she's been gone
I want no one
To talk to me
It's not the same
But I'm to blame
It's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe
That she would leave
Me on my own
It's just not right
Where every night
I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know, I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know, she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know, I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know, she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please don't come near
Just stay away
I'll let you know
When she's come home
Until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
For goodness sake,

Oh yeah.
To lead a better life I need my love to be here... 
Here, making each day of the year 
Changing my life with the wave of her hand 
Nobody can deny that there's something there 
There, running my hands through her hair 
Both of us thinking how good it can be 
Someone is speaking but she doesn't know he's there 
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care 
But to love her is to need her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there 
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me 
I know I need never care 
But to love her is to need her everywhere 
Knowing that love is to share 
Each one believing that love never dies 
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there 
To be there and everywhere 
Here, there and everywhere
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, 
And I say it's all right 
Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter 
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Little darling, the smiles returning to their faces 
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun 
And I say it's all right 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... 
Sun, sun, sun, here it comes... 
Little darling, I feel that ice is slowly melting 
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun, 
And I say it's all right 
Here comes the sun, here comes the sun
It's all right
Help, I need somebody
Help, not just anybody
Help, you know, I need someone
Help
When I was younger
So much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone
I'm not so self-assured
Now I find I've changed my mind
And opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please, help me?
And now my life has changed
In oh, so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then
I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like
I never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please, help me?

Hello, little girl.
Hello, little girl.
Hello, little girl.
When I see you every day,
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When you're passing on your way,
I say, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When I see you passing by,
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
When I try to catch your eye,
I cry, mmm-mmm, hello, little girl.
I send you flowers,
But you don't care.
You never seem to
See me standin' there.
I often wonder
What you're thinkin' of.
I hope it's me
And love, love, love.
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.
It's not the first time,
That it's happened to me.
It's been a long, lonely time
And it's so funny,
So funny to see
That I'm about to loose
My mind, mind, mind.
So I hope there'll come a day when
You say, mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.
Mmm-mmm, you're my little girl.
Mmm-hmm, you're my little girl.
Oh, yeah, you're my little girl.
Brian: Is that it? Is that the end?
John: Fade.
Paul: Fade, that's it.
John: Fade, fade, that's it.
Brian: Wo, stop there, stop there, stop there.
Paul: We're finished.
John: That's the end.
Brian: Alright, George, hold it.
John: Fade, you see...
Brian: Hold it.
John: Fade.
Brian: We did, we did that. Ho', no, no, we've done that bit.
John: The train comes in now...yeah.
Brian: We did that to prove that we weren't playing the record, then you see, 'cause otherwise there's no point in you being here, is there?
John: Yeah, we did that, 'cause that part sounds just like it.
Brian: Pretty cool lot of fellows there aren't you? Here Ringo, have a banana, catch.
She was a working girl 
North of England way 
Now she's hit the big time 
In the U.S.A. 
And if she could only hear me 
This is what I'd say. 
Honey pie you are making me crazy 
I'm in love but I'm lazy 
So won't you please come home. 
Oh honey pie my position is tragic 
Come and show me the magic 
of your Hollywood song. 
You became a legend of the silver screen 
And now the thought of meeting you 
Makes me weak in the knee. 
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic 
Sail across the Atlantic 
To be where you belong. 
Will the wind that blew her boat 
Across the sea 
Kindly send her sailing back to me. 
Honey pie you are making me crazy 
I'm in love but I'm lazy 
So won't you please come home
Come, come back to me, honey pie....
Let me tell you about a girl I know
She's my baby and I love her so
Every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says: baby, I'm all alone
By the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
In the evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and she holds me tight
She says: baby everything is alright
That's why I know, that's why I know
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love her so
Hallelujah I just love that chick so.
I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn't know what I would find there 
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you, 
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life 
You didn't run, you didn't lie 
You knew I wanted just to hold you 
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again 
For I had told you 
Ooh, you were meant to be near me 
Ooh, and I want you hear me 
Say we'll be together every day 
Got to get you into my life 
What can I do, what can I be, 
When I'm with you I want to stay there 
If I'm true I'll never leave 
And if I do I know the way there 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you, 
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life 
Got to get you into my life 
Got to get you into my life 
I was alone, I took a ride, 
I didn't know what I would find there 
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of 
mind there 
Then suddenly I see you, 
Did I tell you I need you...
Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes
Tomorrow I
Will leave and go away
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Songs that linger on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door;
I leave them for
The one who waits behind
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Far away my lover sings
A lonely song and calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums
Invited me on
I must be by his side
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
Goodbye. Goodbye
My love, goodbye
Goodbye
Ah, ha, ha, hi
Goodbye.
Now it's time to say good night 
Good night Sleep tight 
Now the sun turns out his light 
Good night Sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you. 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Good night Sleep tight 
Now the moon begins to shine 
Good night Sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you. 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine 
Good night Sleep tight 
Now the sun turns out his light 
Good night Sleep tight 
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you. 
Good night Good night Everybody 
Everybody everywhere 
Good night.
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in 
Nothing to say but what a day how's your boy been 
Nothing to do it's up to you 
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K. 
Good morning, good morning... 
Going to work don't want to go feeling low down 
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town 
Everybody knows there's nothing doing 
Everything is closed it's like a ruin 
Everyone you see is half asleep. 
And you're on your own you're in the street 
Good morning, good morning... 
After a while you start to smile now you feel cool. 
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school. 
Nothing has changed it's still the same 
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K. 
Good morning, good morning... 
People running round it's five o'clock. 
Everywhere in town is getting dark. 
Everyone you see is full of life. 
It's time for tea and meet the wife. 
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here. 
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear. 
Go to a show you hope she goes. 
I've got nothing to say but it's O.K. 
Good morning, good morning...

I told you about Strawberry Fields 
You know the place where nothing is real 
Well here's another place you can go 
Where everything flows. 
Looking through the bent backed tulips 
To see how the other half live 
Looking through a glass onion. 
I told you about the walrus and me-man 
You know that we're as close as can be-man 
Well here's another clue for you all 
The walrus was Paul. 
Standing on the cast iron shore-yeah 
Lady Madonna trying to make ends meet-yeah 
Looking through a glass onion. 
I told you about the fool on the hill 
I tell you man he living there still 
Well here's another place you can be 
Listen to me. 
Fixing a hole in the ocean 
Trying to make a dove-tail joint-yeah 
Looking through a glass onion.

Man I venture to find
life's adventure is mine
Enter the mind of the lemon on the assembly line
With the heart of a lifesaver swimmer
When I'm pounding through the arctic it's the ice breaker skipper
Life pace depicter
Sky scraper swinger
In flight late in winter
It's that night raven singer
In a dark world with the mind-state of splinter
The light ray emitter when my mic paints the picture
Topic synergy
mixed with exotic imagery
I'm the conductor of this cosmic hypnotic symphony
So witness me, dancin in the spot brah
The ghost in the machine
It's the phantom of this opera
Let's find the truth behind America's hit and run
As they heard me rearin' and tearin' through area 51
The ants scurry under the eye of echelon
Let's get in orbit - let's revive the renaissance
Look at history - half of it is mistold
Cause the winner writes it in this atmospheric fish globe
The grand vista - truth is the best ally
And that's the clutch point through the hoop and the net shall I
continue till were together in reality?
Look how far we've come
We're magelans of the galaxy
See the dots you connect and sew the tapestry
Then stand back from life's mosaic masterpiece
Izm interlude
Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin
I'm a soldier of the sun with a gun that blows roses
Did what they said we couldn't now look whos the no hopers
We can touch god through the power of a crowd
Bush bashing with a butcher knife
how you like me now?
They call me mister magic when I handle a track
I'm from a world where the rabbit pulls the man outta hats
So come along there's nothing wrong with seeing Max on a bear's back
With a bong singing songs in his trackies and airmax
Yo they want me to leave it or love it I'd rather keep it and fuck it
Cause this reefer I'm puffin has got me deep in discussion
And nobody is as free as Eso
I spin the mind out like a BMX spoke
I was sent with a destiny to protect my own pedigree
keep this kept in your memory and I'll bet you'll remember me
This is mental telepathy
On the edge of the cemetry
Where the devil eventually has to step to my weaponry
I'm got infinite ammo
I'm like a ninja in camo
I sit in the shadows and spit like the tip of an arrow
I shoot shit with the sparrows
Until I master the pain
Pardon the flames
Carvin my name in the park when it rains
In the garden of chains
We get lost in the labrynth
Even using half of my brain
Bitch, watch what will happen
So
Do you really think your faster than my blade?
Cause I gotta liquid sword and I'ma park it in your face
Rebels with the hunger to win
That's why three cheeky devils just got under your skin
I see you niggas from the side watchin
Got 100 grand in my side pocket
All the hustlas love it you know I speak the lingo
Tell a bitch give me head
Told that bitch give me head
Told that bitch give me head
Ocho cinco
Face down ass up, pull up in that spaceship with that top down
Bitch pass out, chain light up they blackout
Im like haaanhh ochco cinco thats a head banger
I see a bitch lookin thirsty told her gon drink up
I head hunt, that new nigga, and what
Shorty got that ochco good head, and butt im like(coke boy baby)...
All I got for bitches is pipe water, I came up off a night order
Bitch gave me head till my legs shake
She gave me brain that doesnt explain why these lames be lovin and cuffin these bitches I dont nothin bout em
But they head shape, fuck that pussy till her legs break
Bustin
Got a dirty dozen of them wild thangs waitin in a room like an egg crate
Uhh B.a.d, boy ho, and I got b.a.d bitches for my boys so
Dont treat em like pollo im servin, black suburban, swervin, thru the hood gettin head like turbans head like turbans

Nu vreau money, money, honey, honey
Nu, asta crezi doar tu
Inca ti se pare funny sa te porti ca restu’
Nu-ntelegi, pentru tine stau, pe tine te vreau
Nu vreau money, money, honey, nu
Nu vreau la Miami
Nu, asta crezi doar tu
Si trec anii, anii, anii
Inca ti se pare funny sa te porti ca restu’
Dar nu-ntelegi, pentru tine stau
Acum plang inca, pe tine te vreau
Scuzele tale candva contau, dar acum nu
Oh, baby, cum se face
Ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?
Dar vezi ca roata se-ntoarce
Si-atunci cine-o sa ne-mpace?
Ar trebui sa fii mai atent la cum
Ma consumi pan-o sa ma faci scrum
Cum se face, ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?
Numai tu iesi cu altii-n oras
Bineinteles, ma lasi sa te-astept mereu
Nu uita ca tot acest peisaj dispare ca un miraj
Poate-o fac si eu
Dar nu-ntelegi, pentru tine stau
Acum plang inca, pe tine te vreau
Fetele bune candva existau, dar acum nu
Si-mi vine-o zi sa-mi vad de viata mea
Imi pierd timpul cu tine incercand sa-ti fac ceva
Baby, hai, arata-le ca nu sta treaba chiar asa
Sunt sigura ca dac-ai incerca, sigur ai putea
Sa ma tratezi frumos cum o faceai candva
Sa fim din nou subiectul principal cand cineva
Vorbeste despre cat e de frumoasa dragostea
Oh, baby, cum se face
Ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?
Dar vezi ca roata se-ntoarce
Si-atunci cine-o sa ne-mpace?
Ar trebui sa fii mai atent la cum
Ma consumi pan-o sa ma faci scrum
Cum se face, ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?
Oh, baby, cum se face
Ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?
Dar vezi ca roata se-ntoarce
Si-atunci cine-o sa ne-mpace?
Ar trebui sa fii mai atent la cum
Ma consumi pan-o sa ma faci scrum
Cum se face, ca ma vezi plangand si-ti place?

‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
She's just the girl for me 
And I want all the world to see we've met
Mmm

I might have looked the other way 
And I'd have never been aware
But as it is I'll dream of her tonight
Da da
Falling, yes, I am falling

And kept out of sight

You say goodbye and I say hello

I don't know why you say goodbye, I say hello

Hela heba helloa (Cha cha), hela...
When I wake up early in the morning,
I lift my head, I'm still yawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
I stay in bed, float upstream.
Please don't  wake me,
No, don't shake me,
Leave me where I am,
I'm only sleeping.
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy,
I don't mind, I think they're crazy,
Running everywhere at such a speed,
Till they find there's no need.
Please don't spoil my day,
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping.
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time,
Lying there and staring at the ceiling,
Waiting for a sleepy feeling.
Please don't spoil my day,
I'm miles away
And after all
I'm only sleeping.
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window,
Taking my time,
When I wake up early in the morning,
Lift my head, I'm still yawning.
When I'm in the middle of a dream,
I stay in bed, float upstream.
Please don't wake me,
No, don't shake me,
Leave me where I am
I'm only sleeping.
I'm looking through you, where did you go?
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don't look different, but you have changed 
I'm looking through you, you're not the same 
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear 
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear 
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way 
You were above me, but not today 
The only difference is you're down there 
I'm looking through you and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right? 
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight 
I'm looking through you, where did you go 
I thought I knew you, what did I know 
You don't look different, but you have changed 
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
You're my kind of girl
You make me feel proud
You make me want to shout aloud
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love
Every night I can't sleep thinking of you
And every little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love
I'm in love with wonderful girl
And I never felt so good before -
If this is love give me more more more more
Every night I can't sleep thinking of you
And ever little thing that you do
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love
Yes, I'm telling all my friends
I'm in love...
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you,
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you!
And if you ever say goodbye, 
And if you ever even try, 
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna love you more and more every day
I'm gonna love you more and more every way
And if you ever say goodbye, 
And if you ever even try, 
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you! 
Gonna tell your mama, tell your papa too
So they'll know exactly just what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
If you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you!
Gonna tell your mama, tell your papa too
So they'll know exactly what I'm gonna do
If you ever say goodbye
And if you ever even try
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you!
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you!
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you!
You tell lies
Thinking I can't see
You can't cry
"Cause you're laughing at me
I'm down
I'm really down
I'm down, down on the ground
I'm down
I'm really down
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
Man buys ring
Woman throws it away
Same old thing happens
Everyday
I'm down
I'm really down
I'm down, down on the ground
I'm down, I'm really down
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
We're all alone
And there's nobody else
You'll still moan
"Keep your hands to yourself"
I'm down
I'm really down
I'm down, down on the ground
I'm down, I'm really down
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
How can you laugh
When you know I'm down?
Baby, baby you know I'm down
I'm really down
I guess I'm down
I'm really down
Down on the ground
I'm down
I think I'm upside down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm really down
Can you hear me?
Baby, baby you know I'm down
I'm really down
I guess I'm down
I'm really down
Down on the ground
I'm down
I think I'm upside down
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm really down.
I'm a loser 
I'm a loser 
And I'm not what I appear to be 
Of all the love I have won or have lost 
There is one love I should never have crossed 
She was a girl in a million, my friend 
I should have known she would win in the end 
I'm a loser 
And I lost someone who's near to me 
I'm a loser 
And I'm not what I appear to be 
Although I laugh and I act like a clown 
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown 
My tears are falling like rain from the sky 
Is it for her or myself that I cry 
I'm a loser 
And I lost someone who's near to me 
I'm a loser 
And I'm not what I appear to be 
What have I done to deserve such a fate 
I realize I have left it too late 
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall 
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all 
I'm a loser 
And I lost someone who's near to me 
I'm a loser 
And I'm not what I appear to be
You don't need anybody to hold you
here I stand with my arms open wide
give me love and remember, what I told you
I'll keep you satisfied
You don't need anybody to kiss you
ev'ry day I'll be here by your side
don't go 'way, I'm afraid that I might miss you
I'll keep you satisfied
You can always get a simple thing like love anytime
but it's diff'rent with a boy like me and a love like mine
So believe ev'rything that I told you
and agree that with me by your side
you don't need anybody to hold you
I'll keep you satisfied
You can always get a simple thing like love anytime
but it's diff'rent with a boy like me and a love like mine
So believe ev'rything that I told you
and agree that with me by your side
you don't need anybody to hold you
I'll keep you satisfied
Give me love and remember, what I told you
I'll keep you satisfied.
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined, I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you 'cause it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, there's gonna be a time
Well I'm gonna change your mind
So you might as well resign yourself to me, oh yeah
Imagine, I'm in love with you
It's easy 'cause I know
I've imagined, I'm in love with you
Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, 
Oh yeah, oh yeah.
One day
You'll look to see I've gone,
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.
Some day
You'll know I was the one.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come,
And so, my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know...
Oh, one day
You'll find that I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.
And now the time has come,
And so, my love I must go.
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know...
Oh, one day you'll find
That I have gone.
For tomorrow may rain so
I'll follow the sun.
I've got every reason on earth to be mad, 
'Cause I've just lost the only girl I had. 
If I could get my way, 
I'd get myself locked up today, 
But I can't so I cry instead.
I've got a chip on my shoulder that's bigger than my feet, 
I can't talk to people that I meet. 
If I could see you now,
I'd try to make you sad somehow, 
But I can't so I cry instead.
Don't want to cry when there's people there, 
I get shy when they start to stare, 
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again someday.
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls, 
I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world. 
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two, 
And show you what your loving man can do, 
Until then I'll cry instead.
Don't want to cry when there's people there, 
I get shy when they start to stare, 
I'm gonna hide myself away, ay hay;
But I'll come back again someday.
And when I do you'd better hide all the girls,
'Cause I'm gonna break their hearts all 'round the world. 
Yes, I'm gonna break 'em in two, 
And show you what your loving man can do, 
Until then I'll cry instead.
The sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right, I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way, hey
I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way, oh, oh
I'll be on my way
You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so oh 
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that 
I'm not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize 
That if I ran away 
From you that you would want
Me too, but I've got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that 
I'm not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
Who knows how long I've loved you 
You know I love you still 
Will I wait a lonely lifetime 
If you want me to--I will. 
For if I ever saw you 
I didn't catch your name 
But it never really mattered 
I will always feel the same. 
Love you forever and forever 
Love you with all my heart 
Love you whenever we're together 
Love you when we're apart. 
And when at last I find you 
Your song will fill the air 
Sing it loud so I can hear you 
Make it easy to be near you 
For the things you do endear you to me 
You know I will 
I will.
I want you, I want you so bad
I want you, I want you so bad
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, I want you so bad, babe
I want you, I want you so bad
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, I want you so bad, babe
I want you, I want you so bad
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, I want you so bad
I want you, I want you so bad
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
She's so heavy, heavy, heavy..
She's so heavy, she's so heavy
I want you, I want you so bad
I want you, I want you so bad
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad
I want you, you know I want you so bad, babe
I want you, you know I want you so bad, babe
It's driving me mad
It's driving me mad, yeah..
She's so ...
She's not a girl who misses much 
Do do do do do do do do 
She's well acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand 
Like a lizard on a window pane. 
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors 
On his hobnail boots 
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy 
Working overtime 
A soap impression of his wife which he ate 
And donated to the National Trust.

Down to the bits that I left uptown 
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

"I Saw Her Standing There"
One, two, three, four
Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked 
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another, oh
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long 
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another, wooh
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long 
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another, wooh
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long 
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another, wooh
Since I saw her standing there
Since I saw her standing there

Tell them I remember you
I remember too a distant bell
And stars that dwell
Like the rain out of the blue
When my life is through
And the angels ask me to recall
The thrill of it all
Then I will tell them
I remember you

I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me 
How was I to know you would upset me? 
I didn't realize 
As I looked in your eyes 
You told me
Oh, yes, you told me
You don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me 
And feeling like this 
I just can't go on anymore

I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see 
Just what you mean to me

All I can hear

No-one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely than wine
All through your life, I me mine

But the way that you hurt me
I just don't understand
Well, you say that you need me
Like an ocean needs sand

I'm gonna search this town from door to door
Love I crave, I can't find no more
I gotta find my baby, I declare that ain't a lie
Ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know, I hate to see the sun sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's gonna be one solid mess
I gotta find my baby, I declare that ain't a lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well, ever since that day when we said we were through
I've been nervous and shook up, too
I gotta find my baby, I declare that ain't a lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well, I don't care if it's the last thing I ever do in my life
I'm gonna find that little woman and make her my wife
I gotta find my baby, I declare that ain't a lie
I ain't had no real loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well, I got a woman way across town

I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out, somehow
I think about her almost all the time
Well, the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Well, the day she away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
Baby's good to me, you know, 
She's happy as can be, you know, 
She said so. 
I'm in love with her and I feel fine. 
Baby says she's mine, you know, 
She tells me all the time, you know, 
She said so. 
I'm in love with her and I feel fine. 
I'm so glad that she's my little girl. 
She's so glad, she's telling all the world. 
That her baby buys her things, you know. 
He buys her diamond rings, you know, 
She said so. 
She's in love with me and I feel fine, mmm.

Hey (x3)
Im justin beiber, i am a fag
And i got bum raped, by my dad
Ther was no love, he fucked me hard
And i think he left my bum hole rather scarred
My shit tracks go, to number one
Ive got a hair cut, like Elton john
Hes a poof too, i think its cool
But i still always get bullied in my school
Because my dad....Raped me, raped me, raped me, ooohh
Give me rabies rabies rabies ooohhh
Daddy raped me, raped me, raped me, ohhh
So i thought id sing but i just whine, whine.......
I felt abused, i thought it'd last forever
He even made me use chains whips and leather
He sed just play it cool, but i felt a fool
I cud have anything if he could sting my ring
Ive got diseases, look what you did to me
Couldn't shake me couldn't wake me from my wet dreams
'Is it in yet' OW OW OW OW
And i just cant believe that i kept it quiet for ten pound
Because my dad....Raped me, raped me, raped me, ooohh
Give me rabies rabies rabies ooohhh
Daddy raped me, raped me, raped me, ohhh
So i thought id sing but i just whine, whine.......
When i was 13, i had my first shag
It was bad i wasn't glad, i was a fag
because i got arse raped by my god damn dad!!!
I thought that he was crazy, ya know a mad fuck
I sucked on beans but they wasn't from no starbucks
He made my ass wide, shit come out like rusty water
Whats wrong with my sisters, fuck me off and please fuck ya daughters
Its how i spent my days in
Before i started shaving
now i think cocks amazing
so now im sayin.........
please rape me, rape me rape me, ohhhh
even if ya hate me, hate me, hate me, ohhh
just take me, take me, take me, oohhhhh
just want a guy who i can call mine, mine......
Yo, pay attention
And listen real closely how I break this slang shit down
Check it, my weed smoke is my lye
A ki of coke is a pie
When I'm lifted, I'm high
With new clothes on, I'm fly
Cars is whips and sneakers is kicks
Money is chips, movies is flicks
Also, cribs is homes, jacks is pay phones
Cocaine is nose candy, cigarettes is bones
A radio is a box, a razor blade is a ox
Fat diamonds is rocks and jakes is cop
And if you got rubbed, you got stuck
You got shot, you got bucked
And if you got double-crossed, you got fucked
Your bankroll is your poke, a choke hold is a yoke
A kite is a note, a con is a okey doke
And if you got punched that mean you got snuffed
To clean is to buff, a bull scare is a strong bluff
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
&Speak with criminal slang& -Nas
That's just the way that I talk, yo
&Vocabulary spills, I'm ill& -Nas
Yo, yo
A burglary is a jook, a woof's a crook
Mobb Deep already explained the meanin' of shook
If you caught a felony, you caught a F
If you got killed, you got left
If you got the dragon, you got bad breath
If you 730, that mean you crazy
Hit me on the hip means page me
Angel dust is sherm, if you got AIDS, you got the germ
If a chick gave you a disease, then you got burned
Max mean to relax, guns and pistols is gats
Condoms is hats, critters is cracks
The food you eat is your grub
A victim's a mark
A sweat box is a small club, your tick is your heart
Your apartment is your pad
Your old man is your dad
The studio is the lab and heated is mad
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
The iron horse is the train and champaign is bubbly
A deuce is a honey that's ugly
If your girl is fine, she's a dime
A suit is a fine, jewelry is shine
If you in love, that mean you blind
Genuine is real, a face card is a hundred dollar bill
A very hard, long stare is a grill
If you sneakin' to go see a girl, that mean you creepin'
Smilin' is cheesin', bleedin' is leakin'
Beggin is bummin, if you nuttin you comin
Takin' orders is sunnin', an ounce of coke is a onion
A hotel's a telly, a cell phone's a celly
Jealous is jelly, your food box is your belly
To guerrilla mean to use physical force
You took a L, you took a loss
To show off mean floss, uh
I know you like the way I'm freakin' it
I talk with slang and I'ma never stop speakin' it
Yeah, yeah
One love to my big brother, Big Lee
Holdin' it down
Yeah, Flamboyant for life
Yeah yeah, Flamboyant for life

Her Majesty is a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm gonna make her mine
Oh yeah, someday I'm gonna make her mine

Shippity bop, well hot diggity, where's the iggity? The bum siggity
Niggas wanna know but check the flow my little trickity
I'm comin with the Books so kid, it looks like it's a winner
Ya better get'cha plate because I'm servin raps for dinner
See I freak it from the sewer plus I'm quick to do ya posse
I'm swoopin on the note just like I was a kamikaze
See they thought I lost my spot so they went and got real comfy
So now I gotta hit me hard and bogart like Humphrey
Ya hypocrite, I'm rippin it because I'm flyer
Ya phony, full of bologne like Oscar Meyer
See I attack a pack of rappers just for practice
I bust my tactics, I'm sharper than a f----- axe-iss
Yeah it's the Books in reverse, the next cap sendin a big-up to my borough
I'm thorough, wetter than a ghetto from Medini-Bop
Takin lessons, swayin niggas on graffitti
Rockin other slang ranger, bring a banger ???? occasion
My nerves is achin, see I'm sick of niggas perpetratin
But can't see this, I'm screamin on they records like Beavis
or Butthead, I bust heads like Amy
Fisher isser, blisser, hit you like an accident
and if I'm in your town you might meet me at the Radisson
or splatterin, batterin crews for lip chatterin
It ain't nuttin new, that's how we do, my crew is back again
Chorus:
Bak 'n' affek, how's that?

nigga on the microphone cos I can roll a sister
Word is bond, I'm on some nuke ----, new ---- like this
Grab a piece of steel and shoot the giff like Chris
Cringle, lost my jingle, don't it make ya shiver
Give a nigga what he needs so he can bleed when I deliver
Aah microphone check, what the heck?
I do that then because I used to catch a wreck
wit it, that's the time I hot talk, spit it
For Christ's sake I'm in to hit the brakes and you're skiddin
You ---- in, messiah did it, but y'all can keep that
Cos now I'm on some other type of flow and best believe that
And all that, small cat, my format - deranged
Honey I'm back to run things cos some things is never changed, punk!
So if you're drunk, I freak the funk until you're sober
but still be gettin chills when niggas know that winter's over
Kickin the flam yo it's the man, tick tock, I jam like gridlock
My style is fender bendin sendin rappers to the pitstop
Good lord o' mercy, hit reversy if you missed it
and busboy give the speech cos like a preacher, baby I'm twisted
Kid I swing a dome-buster light, bone crush a *?smith?*
Bust up your lips then puff up a spliff
So yo, who be dat? Dat wanna do me like this to get

Chorus

Qu'il est fort ce petit,
Qui veut à tout prix se battre
Qui te parle comme avant
Qui t'expliques pertinament
Qui te rassures peut-être
Qui te dis intelligemment
Que demain c'est peut-être
Essuis tes larmes petit Tom
A bord de ton sourire de printemps je te trouve encore plus beau maintenant
Essuis tes larmes petit Tom
Toi qui ne baisse jamais les bras ca fera de toi un trés grand tu verras
Essuis tes larmes patit Tom

Et à en voir sur les murs
Y en a beaucoups qui t'aime
Qui te parlent comme un grand

Mais toi ta compris depuis longtemps
Que tout (dérive) dans la tête

Devant un grand comme toi
Je t'apprends à te regarder
Que l'on a jamais vécu assez
Je me sens si petite
Tu vois
Essuis tes larmes petit Tom
A bord de ton sourire de printemps je te trouve encore plus beau maintenant
Essuis tes larmes petit Tom
Toi qui ne baisse jamais les bras ca fera de toi un trés grand tu verras
Essuis tes larmes patit Tom
Promise Heron I'll put my fist up after I get my dick sucked
Quick buck, maybe a gold chain
With that fucking flow that s-s-so belittles men
They tentatively tend to turn and go when I am finished
Stone cold, hardly fucking with these niggas, nigga listen
The description doesn't fit, if not a synonym of menace
Then forget it, in turn these critics and interns
Admitting the shit spit, it just burn like six furnaces
Written to fix learning them digits and simultaneously
Dispelling "one-trick-pony" myths, isn't he?
One adolescent, fucking six nigga energy
And crawling down 'Fax like a rich nigga centipede
Crack ceramic and slap a hand out of cash account
Stamp and shouting, thrashing, these niggas done let the Kraken out
Crack-a-lackin, like snap, crackle, poppin' your ammo off
Hide your face, and throw your flannels off, Sweatshirt, nigga
'87 roof top rising
Whipping hoopties, tryna boost raw chronic
(Grew this in that booth, double scoop, hock vomit up, sub rocking
Thud knocking niggas teeth loose)
Bruh, I don't fuck with no cops (Rolling with that flow swamp)
Catch me over stove top (Rapping to that coke rock)
From that city that's recession-hit, where stressed
Niggas could flex metal with pedal to rake pennies in
Desolate testaments trying to stay Jekyll-ish
But most niggas Hyde and Brenda just stay pregnant
Breaking news: death's less important when the Lakers lose
It's lead in that baby food, heads try to make it through
Fish-netted legs for them eyes that she cater to
Ride dirty as the fucking sky that you praying to
So here I sit, eye in the pyramid
God spit it like it's truth serum in that beer and then
Top of a lear steering it into the kids' ear again
Provider of the backdrop music
For the crack rock user and the mascot, Earl
Rawer than the skin, knee cap on that black top
Salivary glands lighter fluid for the matchbox
Striking, wait, wait, who the fuck you badder than?
Boy oh boy, I'm bad as burnt pollo off the grill and shit
Spitter of the little nick, nimble rick rolling
Bitch niggas pick litter, piff-blower, plus I pillage shit
Quit with all that tough talk, bruh, we know you niggas ain't about shit
Come around, we gun 'em down, bodies piled, Auschwitz
Bulletproof outfits, weapons concealed
I'm ready to kill, so test it, all my weapons is real
Selling thizz, couldn't tell him what the recipe is
Got 'em wishing that they never gave these weapons to kids, cheers
Send chills up spines of fat bitches after
Shows throwing out sandwiches, niggas get it how they
Live and I live for money, other words, I'm getting money
Little boy told me when it’s time to ride, they’ll send them for me
Ain't nobody scaring me, niggas ain't prepared for heat
Tools hit like pool sticks, the way I cue shit
If this was '88, I would have signed to Ruthless
'94 would have had them walking down Death Row
First is when the best go, hate is what the rest do
Voice inside my head told me wet 'em if they test you
So it's raging water season
That yomper big as Larry Johnson, leave your momma seedless
Everybody hard until it's only God they seeing
Kittens soft but in they songs be trapping hard as Jeezy, I don't believe it
But to each his own, I ain't tripping long as I can reach the chrome
Heat your home like Southern California Gas, police pass
Tell 'em free Smalls, off Palm with the heat drawn
Strapped up long as the chief for police armed
Raised where the beasts are, north of the Beach
A couple streets past Baby Jay, bony niggas spraying Ks
Ruger with the pork face, Jewish for the court case
Here to save you niggas from the sorbet, Coldchain
Like it's nothing cause it's nothing, bitch
Each time I look into your eyes
I see that there, there heaven lies
And as I look
I see the love of the loved
Someday they'll see that from the start
My place has been deep in your heart
And in your heart
I see the love of the loved
Though I've said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure you love me
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me and say 
Ah, you love me..
So let it rain, I'll never care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved
Though I've said it all before
I will say it more and more
Now that I'm really sure you love me
And I know that from today
I'll see it in the way
That you look at me and say 
Ah, you love me..
So let it rain, I'll never I care
Deep in your heart, I'd still be there
And when I'm there
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved
I see the love of the loved...
Damn I hate being sober, I'm a smoker

Drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, drink and smoke it, we out for sure
I came in back of that Rolls, nigga I ain't stuntin' them hoes

Trick, what you spend on her, we spend on clothes
Too young for me she want Sosa, shooters in the Range Rover

See my ring chain and my Rolex when I'm flexin'
Bitch I got to get mine, nigga get outta line, I check 'em
See this gangsta shit, stuntin' to perfection
Nigga better believe me, I make it look easy
My weed so strong, my cheese so long
Roll so many joints soon I might need a loan
Spend so many grands that I might need some bands
Thats your bitch why she acting like she need a man?
I'm faded, talking mills cause I made it
Talking pounds cause I smoke it
Talking game cause I played it

I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes
I got the lumps in my throat
When I saw her coming down the isle
I get the wiggles in my knee
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
I said: go go go little Queenie
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
She's looking like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was still thinking,
If it's a slow song, we'll omit it
If it's a rocker, that'll get it
And if it's good, she'll admit it
Come on, Queenie, let's get with it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeh she looks like the model
On the cover of a magazine
Why she's too cute
To be a minute over seventeen
Meanwhile I was thinking
She's in the mood, no need to break it
I got a chance, I ought to take it
If she'll dance, we can make it
Come on Queenie, let's shake it
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie
Go go go little Queenie

And so it seems
That I will love her
Oh, you, you are that girl in my dreams

Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
I need to laugh and when the sun is out 
I've got something I can laugh about 
I feel good in a special way 
I'm in love and it's a sunny day 
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
We take a walk, the sun is shining down 
Burns my feet as they touch the ground 
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine 
Then we'd lie beneath the shady tree 
I love her and she's loving me 
She feels good, she knows she's looking fine 
I'm so proud to know that she is mine. 
Good day sunshine, good day sunshine, good day sunshine
I want to tell you 
My head is filled with things to say 
When you're here 
All those words, they seem to slip away 
When I get near you, 
The games begin to drag me down 
It's all right 
I'll make you maybe next time around 
But if I seem to act unkind 
It's only me, it's not my mind 
That is confusing things. 
I want to tell you 
I feel hung up but I don't know why, 
I don't mind 
I could wait forever, I've got time 
Sometimes I wish I knew you well, 
Then I could speak my mind and tell you 
Maybe you'd understand 
I want to tell you 
I feel hung up but I don't know why, 
I don't mind 
I could wait forever, I've got time, I've got time, I've got time
Lend me your comb,
it's time to go home.
I got to go past,
my hair is a mess
Your mammie will scold,
your pappie will shout.
Unless we come in
the way we went out.
Kissing you was fun honey
but thanks for the date.
But I must come to run honey,
but you know baby it's getting late.
Just wait till I
say: my darling,
lend me your comb.
We got to go home.
Kissing you was fun honey
but thanks for the date.
But I must come to run, honey.
but sugar, it's getting late.
Just wait till I
say: my darling,
lend me your comb.
We got to go home.
You better leave my kitten all alone,
you better leave my kitten all alone.
But I told you big fat bulldog,
you better leave her alone.
You better leave my kitten all alone,
you better leave my kitten all alone.
This dog is gonna get you
if you don't leave her alone.
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you
on the top of your head.
That child is gonna miss you,
you gonna wish that you were dead.
If you don't leave my kitten all alone.
Well I told you big fat bulldog,
you better leave her alone.
Well Mr.Dog I'm gonna hit you
on the top of your head.
That girl is gonna miss you,
you gonna wish that you were dead.
If you don't leave my kitten all alone, oh yeah.
Well I told you, big fat bulldog,
you better leave her alone.
Hey hey you better leave, you better leave,
you better leave, yeah you better leave,
you better leave, oh you got to leave... 
Lady Madonna,
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet.
Who find the money
When you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna
Lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is neverending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna,
Children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

We've been friends for, oh, so long

When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line 
Keep your hands off my baby (Keep your hands)

But I say it just to reach you, Julia 
Julia, Julia, oceanchild, calls me 
So I sing a song of love, Julia

Deep down Louisiana close to New Orleans,
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens.
There stood a log cabin made of earth and wood,
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode.
Who never ever learned to read or write so well,
But he could play the guitar just like a ringing a bell.
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Johnny B. Goode!
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack,
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track.
Oh, the engineerswould see him sitting in the shade,
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made.
People passing by they used to  stop and say,
Oh, my that little country boy could play.
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Johnny B. Goode!
His mother told him "Someday you will be a man,
And you will be the leader of a big old band.
Many people coming from miles around,
To hear you play your music when the sun go dow.
Maybe someday your name will be in lights,
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight."
Go go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Go Johnny go go
Go
Johnny B. Goode!
I get high when I see you go by
My, oh my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy
When I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes night-time bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes, it's so hard loving you
Loving you
It's all too much, it's all too much
When I look into your eyes
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside
The more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
From life to life with me
Makes no diff'rence where you are
Or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece, but not too much
Sell me on a silver sun
Where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm ev'rywhere
And get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn the less I know
And what I do is only work
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
Everywhere it's what you make
For us to take it's all too much
It's too much, it's too much
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue..
Too much, too much...
It won't be long
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
It won't be long
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
It won't be long
Yeah (yeah)

You're coming on home (now you're coming on home)
I'll be good like I know I should (yes, you should be)
You're coming home (aaah)
You're coming home
Every night the tears come down from my eye
Every day I've done nothing but cry
It won't be long

Now I know that you won't leave me no more
It won't be long
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)
It won't be long
It won't be long
Yeah (yeah)
'Til I belong to you
I've got a feeling, a feeling deep inside
Oh yeah (oh yeah)

Oh no, no

All these years I've been wandering around
Wondering how come nobody told me
All that I was looking for was somebody who looked like you
I've got a feeling
That keeps me on my toes
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
I've got a feeling
I think that everybody knows
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah
I have got a feeling, yeah
Everybody had a hard year
Everybody had a good time
Everybody had a wet dream
Everybody saw the sun shine
Oh yeah (oh yeah)
Oh,yeah, oh yeah
Everybody had a good year
Everybody let their hair down
Everybody pulled their socks up (yeah)
Everybody put their foot down, oh yeah
Oh yeah (Yeah)
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
I've got a feeling
Yeah
Oh, my soul
So hard
There are places I'll remember 
All my life though some have changed 
Some forever not for better 
Some have gone and some remain 
All these places have their moments 
With lovers and friends I still can recall 
Some are dead and some are living 
In my life I've loved them all 
But of all these friends and lovers 
There is no one compares with you 
And these memories lose their meaning 
When I think of love as something new 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
Though I know I'll never lose affection 
For people and things that went before 
I know I'll often stop and think about them 
In my life I love you more 
In my life I love you more
If you've got troubles
Then you've got less troubles than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me (oh oh)
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantages you've had over me
Just 'cause you're troubled
Then don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamonds and rings. (oh oh)
You think I'm soft in the head
Well, try someone softer instead, pretty thing
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring
You'd better leave me alone,*
I don't need a thing from you
You'd better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
If you've got troubles
Then you've got less troubles than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantages you've had over me
Just 'cause you're troubled
Then don't bring your troubles to me
Ahh Rock on, anybody!
If you've got troubles
Then you've got less troubles than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me. (oh oh)
You're quite content to be bad
With all the advantages you've had over me
Just 'cause you're troubled
Then don't bring your troubles to me
Just 'cause you're troubled
Then don't bring your troubles to me.
If I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day 
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah
Greetings, earthlings 
We have now taken over your radioooo..... 
Goin' straight through the hole 
You ain't got no game 
I'm breakin' ya out the frame 
Coming through like a train 
Looking to take over the world is my goal 
With my unstoppable crew takin' all control 
You can't get none of this, we're runnin' this 
Well taker, earth shaker, 3 point gunnin' this 
Get out the lane, i'm comin' through 
And if you don't wanna move then i'm comin' right through you 
It's like inch by inch and step by step 
I'm closing in on your position and destruction is my mission 
Though eight is not enough, your whole squad better duck 
It's like switch when I bust 
Now you're whole crew is dust 
Comin' through my area, i'ma have to bury ya 
The real scream team on your scream scene 
It's like showdown on the range 
Go tell me who wanna tangle with the 
ghetto witch-doctor neighborhood superhero? 
Chorus: 
We want it all (want it all!) 
Unstoppable, we run the floor (run the floor!) 
You can't take none of this hardcore (hardcore!) 
In the game we take you to war (war!) 
You ain't seen nothin' like this before 
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high 
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low 
If I hit 'em high, hit 'em high, hit 'em high 
And you hit 'em low, hit 'em low, hit 'em low 
Insane like a runaway train i'm in your lane 
Like it's only 3 seconds to score to win the game 
Came to bring the ultimate pain upon the brain 
Untamed, you won't like it when I change 
And you are type strange 
Make room, manaical monster in the game 
And I got my eye on you 
Deadshot aim, as free throws keep comin' down like rain 
You feelin' me, I'm feelin' you 
The Monstar again, i'm tellin' you 
Pass me the rock, now i'm headed to the basket 
Get up out my way is what you better do 
My tactics is unsportsmanlike conduct 
You better ask it 
Don't get no better than this, you catch my drift? 
You get stripped by ballhandlers ruled by Swackhammer 
Danger, you're dealin' with offical hoop-bangers 
With hang time like a coat hanger 
Jump, with thunderous 360-degree type dunks 
What up doc? The Monstar funk 
Lightning strikes and the court lights get dim 
Supreme competition is about to begin 
Above the rim, finessin' and moves is animated 
Once I get to ballin', I can't be deflated 
I'm rugged raw, my Monstars is gettin' money 
When clicks get to buggin', I'm snatchin' up their bunnies (Uhh!) 
Every step I take shakes the ground 
I'll make you break your ankles, son, shakes you down 
This is my planet, I'm bout business 
The best that ever done it, can I get a witness? (Uhhh!) 
Cumulus clouds bring darkness up above 
You in it for the money? 
Or in it for the love, M.J.? 
23 ways to make a pay 
Loungin' in the mothership back around my way (Uhh!) 
I'm 28 light years old 
If the refs get political, dribble like Bob Dole 
Am I gettin' lyrical? 
Daddy, I think so 
Monstar droppin' flavor fluid so drink slow 
Chorus 
Yo, god bless!! 
Pick up your chest 
Here's an example of how I can stress your full court press 
With finesse, I bench-press your stress whenever you test 
We're speed ballin', on the fastbreak just like the pony express 
I'm gonna mingle in your face and take the lid off 
Just use your head and forfeit the game 
You and your team just need to back off!! 
Get off my block, gimmie the ball, I said it's my rock!! 
I'm startin' a line-up by gettin' y'all to bring the livestock 
Throw all your money in the pot 
And make sure you bet all your money on my bank shot 
When we come right through tell me what you really gonna do? 
We'll leave your team name in shame and take your talent from you 
While you abandon your ship, we take your championship 
With nothing left for you to see except the instant replay clip 
Money spending, goal tending, stay-bending teams like crash cars 
Who do they be? 
They be the Monstars!!!!!! 
All you hoes, callin' here for my daddy get off his dick.
Like that Mommy?
[Answering machine beep in between each message and the beat
to]

When it comes to sex, I'm similar to the thriller in Manila
Honeys call me Bigga the condom filler
Whether it's stiff tongue or stiff dick
Biggie squeeze it to make shit fit, now check this shit
I got the pack of Rough Riders in the back of the Pathfinder
You know the ep along by James Todd Smith
I get swift with the lyrical gift
Hit you with the dick, make your kidneys shift
Here we go, here we go, but I'm not Domino
I got the funk flow to make your drawers drop slow
So recognize the dick size in these Karl Kani jeans
I'm in thirteens, know what I mean
I fuck around and hit you with the Hennessey dick
Mess around and go blind, don't get to see shit
The next batter, here to shatter your bladder, it doesn't
matter
Skinny or fat or white-skinned or black, baby I drop
These boricua mommies screamin "Aiy papi!"
I love it when they call me Big Poppa
I only smoke blunts if they roll propa
Look, I gotcha caught up in the drunk flow
Fuck tae kwon do, I tote da fo'-fo'
For niggaz gettin mad cause they bitch chose me
A big black motherfucker with g ya see
All I do is separate the game from the truth
Big bang boots from the Bronx to Bolivia
Gettin Physical like Olivia Newt
Tricks suck my clique dick all day with no trivia
So gimme a hoe, a bankroll and a bag of weed
I'm guaranteed to fuck her till her nose bleed
Even if your new man's a certified mack
You'll get that H-town in ya, you'll want that old thing back
Oh Biggie gimme one more chance
I got that good dick girl, ya didn't know
Is my mind playin tricks, like Scarface and Bushwick
Willie D, havin nightmares of girls killin me
She mad because what we had didn't last
I'm glad because her cousin let me hit the ass
Fuck the past let's dwell on the 500 SL, the E and J and ginger
ale
The way my pockets swell to the rim with Benjamins
Another hon's in the crib, please send her in
I fuck nonstop, lick my lips alot, used to lick the clits
alot
But lickin clits had to stop
Cause y'all don't know how to act when the tongue go down
below
Peep the funk flow, really though
I got the cleanest meanest penis, ya never seen this stroke of
genius
So take off your Tim boots and your bodysuit
I mean the spandex and hit my man next
Sex gettin rougher when it come to the nut buster
Pussy crusher, black nasty motherfucker
I don't chase em, I replace em
and if I'm caressin em, I'm undressin em
Fuck whatcha heard who's the best in New York
For fillin fantasies without that nigga Mr. Rourke?
Or Tattoo I got you wrapped around my dick
And when I'm done I got to split shit
Back shots is my position, I gotcha wishin for an
intermission
Fuck the kissin, lickin down to your belly button, I ain't
frontin
They don't call me B.I.G. for nuttin, all of a sudden
Oh Biggie gimme one more chance
I got that good dick girl you didn't know
When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom 
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right in front of me, 
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom 
Let it be 
And when the broken hearted people
Living in the world agree
There will be an answer 
Let it be
For though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom 
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
And when the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine on until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Ya'll niggas wanna get high, well we gonna get high then
This shit right here is drugs, ya'll for sell baby
50 Cent uh, take it how you wanna take it nigga[Verse 1]
Yo aiyyo, aiyyo, there is six different wings in the spot, choose one
Some get addicted, some do it for fun
Boy my hoes are clean, just like my guns
And I keep them in a safe place, just like my funds
I keep all my big bills, give my wifey the ones
Frontin' and I'll clap your ass and leave you for dead son
Niggas who know me, know how I get down, I'm fresh out the pound
NYPD crit the flip, get on some New York undercover shit
Fuck wit dogs you ain't familiar wit, and get bit
Niggas scripted through the hit, for some paper and shit
It's all about the cash, keep it in a stash
Some niggas talk shit wit they ass, I see through them like glass
Popo lookin' for me, for some shit I did in the past
If you don't like me at first, I'm gonna grow on you like a rash
This rap shit, I got it in smash, I'm built to last
Feel the wrath, I bust that ass, sit back and laugh (haha)[Chorus: repeat 2X]
You don't have to respect a nigga, but respect his cash
Cause for the money, niggas will murder that ass
I came up fast, I watched a lot of gats blast
The power of the dollar (the cash, the cash)[Verse 2]
Nigga don't you ever forget, I call the shots
I run the spots, extort your pops, flossin' drops
I'm Livin Off Xperience like Lox, I'm hot
Check what I got, shorty got knocked
Comin' up out the capsule spot
On the uptown block, he couldn't run from the cops
So my man got shot
In a jet black Brasada, across the street from his mom's crib on his block
I told him get them niggas that cash, they murdered that ass
Niggas told 'em slow down, he was movin' too fast
Heard the shot, went through his face after the glass, he crashed
Hit the three on his niggas grass, the cattle said it got low fast
The kid who had it done was a crude fella
Who woulda thought he wile out over that mozzarella
We ain't know them, but now we know better
Not to fuck with his cheddar, his man pack a beretta
He won't hesitate to squeeze that, over that green back
Believe that, now niggas know that he's back[Chorus][Verse 3]
I ain't got a worry in the world, if it's beef, don't sing it, bring it
Parents warn their kids, about people like me
I'm out of order, I turn your only daughter, into a transporter
Before I die, I'm gonna see more blow than Rich Porter (woo)
50 Cent, don't get it fucked up for greens, I for greens
Let it go back to Smith, I dissect it
I check and correct it, flow perfected
I make shit hectic, I wreck shit, nigga check it
If you ain't tryin' to feel the flames from the blast
Respect a nigga cash
My smile will rock niggas to sleep, pack heat
Fuck the police, handle beef on the street
On a scale of 1 to 10, I'm a 9 with 2 MM's
If your man want to get involved, I'll bring it to him
Niggas been wantin' me dead, I'm still here kid
They send their dogs to come get me
They wet shit, but they ain't hit me
Word in the hood is 50, shifty
Niggas they don't want to go against me
Cause they know I hunt your ass alive[Chorus]
In spite of all the danger, 
In spite of all that may be 
I'll do anything for you, 
Anything you want me to, 
If you'll be true to me 
In spite of all the heartache, 
That you may cause me, 
I'll do anything for you, 
Anything you want me to, 
If you'll be true to me 
I'll look after you 
Like I've never done before 
I'll keep all the others 
From knocking at your door 
In spite of all the danger, 
In spite of all that may be, 
I'll do anything for you, 
Anything you want me to, 
If you'll be true to me 
In spite of all the heartache, 
That you may cause me, 
I'll do anything for you, 
Anything you want me to, 
If you'll be true to me 
I'll do anything for you 
Anything you want me to, 
If you'll be true to me

Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Got a shit-eating grin
Bitch, show me them itty-bitty titties again
We're in Sin City
Since when did we begin to get dignity
No diggity, bitch, you need to run and go get your figgity-friends
I'm lookin' at your bum-stiggity-bum, hun
The miggity mack's biggity back, don't act wiggity-wack
You can get the figgity-finger; the middle
You little dizzy bitch, sit and spiggaty-spin
Got a 6 o'clock cravin', stop, get Ciroc
It's 'bout to be an unbelievable night
I'll call it surreal, Sir Mix-a-Lot tape in
Hit the spot, spot my next victim
I'm picky like I missed a spot shavin'
Came to sip vodka, shit
Yeah, that little chick is hot but if she got rabies
I wouldn't give the bitch a shot, I'd poke her in the rear
But I bet if I licke her, she'll try to chase me (Ha-ha)
What are you: pit, rott, mixed?
Or you just got fixed, well, shit, then let's lip-lock
If not, then trick, piss off, you snobby little pig snot nose
You think you're hot shit cause you're in heat
Well, bitch, if you're solar, then I'm your polar opposite, dog
Cause I'm colder than popsicle sticks, poppin' shit
Talkin' it, walkin' it, spit boxin'
My sick thoughts are 'bout to lick shots, like the shit's sobbin'
And drip-droppin' in chocolatey whip-toppin'
So whether you're hip-hop, Slipknot, B.I.G., Pac
Kid Rock, Kris Kross, Rick Ross, you'll dig this
If not, then kick rocks in flip flops
And I produced the track
So you don't have to ask who it is when this shit knocks (Turn up!)
So crank the volume 'til it's bangin' and I'ma keep on sayin'
All the shit I should be hung for, and probably killed for sayin'
And I probably will, but not until the day I pop a pill again
Like Joplin and if that don't do the job of killin' Shady, then the karma will
They sayin' I must bring it as Mohammad
Until the Parkinson's done ate away my brain
And made me Robin Williams crazy
Or I end up with dementia, but you rockin' with a sadist
Hate to say this, but if the thought is entertainin'
I ain't stoppin' til we explain it
Oh my god, for real man, not again I'm shakin'
But before I tie a rope around this nob
If they don't like it, got a knob that they can slob on until -
Wait, I just forgot what I was thinkin'..
What's it called again? I'm blankin'
The thing above the balls between my legs
And I think that I can feel it dangling, it's throbbing and it's veiny
Wait, I think that I got it, okay, bitch I got you, Robin Williams hangin'
Bitch don't hang in the lobby unless you came to slob me
Come on kemosabe
It's past time, like your favorite hobby
Cause if the way that I spit she remains on my dick then she grab me by the nuts and tried to take my sausage as a hostage
Ain't it obvious? Pretty much a no brainer
Or should I say Cobainer?
That she's plain addicted to my dick like Lorena Bobbit
Gotta weiner off it, wane her off it like she took my fucking penis, chopped it, and stuck it up between her armpit
And she begun to swing a karambit knife and paint the carpet, at least that's what her train of thought is
Cause I came to conquer it, hit it, quit it, and made her plain b-bonkers
And I always end up giving these bitches a complex
And I don't mean apartment
So spread your feet apart
And let me see you do some yoga stretches, splits
Now grab this Cuisinart
And make me breakfast, bitch, that's a prerequisite
And that's just to get in this bedroom, bitch
Walked up to that Ke$ha chick (what up?)
Said my name is Booger, wanna catch a flick?
I'll even let you pick, make her fetch a stick
Bet you if you give this old dog these new tricks
To get familiar with I learned extra quick
Kick a pregnant bitch, oops, I guess the shit
Took an unexpected twist like the neck of the freaking exorcist
Cha-cha-cha
Bitch, I said that this mask ain't for hockey
Hate Versace, Versace, I got Münchhausen by proxy
I'm making you sick, don't pretend you can't hear me
You deaf, girl, I said you was foxy
I'll tell a bitch like Bizarre
Bitch, shut the fuck up and get in my car
And suck my fucking dick while I take a shit
And I think with my dick so come blow my mind
And it tastes like humble pie
So swallow my pride, you're lucky just to follow my ride
If I let you run alongside the Humvee
Unless you're Nicki, grab you by the wrist, let's ski
So what's it gon' be? Put that shit away Iggy
You gon' blow that rape whistle or me?
'Fore I get lost we're gettin' off
Like this is our exit, now lets hit the highway and try not to get lost
'Till we get to Las Vegas
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
Vegas
'Till we get to Las Vegas
Vegas
Whatever happens here, stays here
So let's go all the way dear
Til we get to Las Vegas
Whatever happens in my room, it stays in my room like movie night like cable
Treat every women in my stable like flavors
Lick her like she kryptonite and I get weak after like 7 days
And 7 nights in the Days Inn, it's Hot Vegas
We roll in circles and packs, we the lifesavers
She got a boyfriend, I got a toy then
I'll bring it with me when I show up to her crib waving
And I ain't tryna meet a nice neighbor
I'm so Jay Electronic, I'm cut like I'm all out of razors
And all I got is a gun left with a bayonet on it
Neck so frozen it look like I walked in a jewelry store
With about a million dollars with your mama
And sat down and did an ALS challenge, haaaan
I stole that adlib from French, Bad & Evil back at it again
About to get my back tatted again
About to get a pic of a backstabber with an axe in his hand
Sitting on a bike in the sand
If you ain't been through nothing
Then that shouldn't mean nothing to you like likes on the Gram
If she current I keep her pussy purring like the pipes on a Lamb
Weed got her so chinky eyed
Look like she been getting high on a flight to Japan
I keep my jewelry on while I'm fucking
Sound like I'm shaking up dice in a can
Listen, though this ain't Christmas I make you my ex miss
If this is my passion
I learn to give those who don't appreciate my presence
The gift of my absence
I don't know who you been listening to
Got me fucked up like Pookie in the chicken coop
Bitch, I don't give a two shits
Bitch, get the fuck out of my face
To make a long story short, I don't really gotta stand there
And listen to you while you throw a silly tantrum
Even though I have an affinity for a witty banter
Starting to feel like foulplay like Billy Laimbeer
Hold up, she misunderstood me
I said say, por favor
Thought I said the Wraith had four doors
I knock a nigga face off
Give him the bottom of the nine like a baseball scoreboard (whatever..)
I leave the club with my tab still open
Won't even get a cab for you and your friend
The only fear I have is of loathing
And I won't even kick in 'till we get to Las Vegas
Turn me loose
Break 'em off some
Yeah
Good cop, good cop rollin' with that bad cop
What'cha doin', boy? Turn in that blood clot
Buck shots, they fly through drug spot
Robots can give a damn who the fuck shot
Clean cop, clean cop, fuckin' with that dirty cop
Don't act like yo ass never heard of that
Clean cop, clean cop rollin' with that mean cop
Still tryna act proud as a peacock
You know that mean cop might need a detox
Mothafucka tried to blow me out me Reeboks
But I swing like Jack and the Beanstalk
Chop 'em down when these bitches try to lock me down
Hit the ground hit the turf
Warp the earth
Cube kidnap your mind, Patty Hearst
Bust a verse that a make yo ass hit reverse
Kill the curse that was placed on the universe
West Coast war lord blacker than the Black Knight
Fuck a black and white when they ain't actin' right
Good cop, good cop filling out your report
Bad cop asking you to distort
Bad cop asking you to lie in court
Send another young brother up north
Send another young sista off course
While these mothafuckas chill on the golf course
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Lazy cop fuckin' with that crazy Cop
Always bragging 'bout the new case he got
Do or die cop with the suicide cop
"Tell the truth" cop with that - "you a lie' cop
Are you fuckin' high, cop? Don't even try cop
Ain't no mothafuckin' drugs up in my spot
All you find in my closet is the high tops
And my mothafuckin' tickets to the skybox
Hold up, nigga, I'm a rider
You's a roll-up, yep the controller
Make me mad that's when I get swole up
The Incredible Hulk is bipolar
Come out the cuffs knock off the rust
Throw my hands up you still wanna bust
The Trojan horse is full of excessive force
When they try to get aggressive nigga off the porch
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
Good cop, good cop, where is your dignity?
Where's your empathy? Where is your sympathy?
Bad cop, where's your humanity?
Good cop, is that just a fantasy?
Hell on that nigga, snitch on that bitch
Truth be told, mothafuck the blue code
Fuck the po-po actin' like Deebo
Already know Craig'll let the brick go
Black Lives Matter is not chit chatter
'Cause all they wanna do, is scatter brain matter
A mind is a terrible thing to waste
A nine is terrible in your face
The mace has a terrible fuckin' taste
The pen is a terrible fuckin' place
The kings all hate the fuckin' ace
The judge sabotaged my fuckin' case
Racist motherfucker
Black police showin' out for the white cop
White police showin' out for the black cop
You're no good for me
But the way you movin at me, oh it might be
You want a Jamaican one
She say she love me and I'm nice
Nothing after he return, nothing at the night
She say it's loving, make this down
No time at all, she don't wanna line
She touch me, it all become nice

When I find myself in times of trouble, 
Mother Mary comes to me, 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
And in my hour of darkness, 
She is standing right in front of me, 
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be. 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be. 
When all the broken hearted people, 
Living in the world agree, 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
For though they may be parted there is, 
Still a chance that they will see, 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be. 
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be. 
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, let it be. 
There will be an answer, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, 
There is still a light that shines on me, 
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be. 
I wake up to the sound of music, 
Mother Mary comes to me. 
There will be no sorrow, let it be
Let it be, let it be. Yeah let it be, let it be. 
There will be no sorrow, let it be. 
Let it be, let it be. Let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
It's been a long long long time
How could I ever have lost you 
When I loved you. 
It took a long long long time 
Now I'm so happy I found you 
How I love you 
So many tears I was searching, 
So many tears I was wasting, oh. Oh-- 
Now I can see you, be you 
How can I ever misplace you 
How I want you 
Oh I love you 
Your know that I need you. 
Ooh I love you.

Yeah 
Motherfuckers better know... huh, huh 
Lock your windows, close your doors 
Biggie Smalls, huh... yeah 
My man Inf left a Tec and a nine at my crib 
Turned himself in, he had to do a bid 
A one-to-three, he be home the end of '93 
I'm ready to get this paper, G, you with me? 
Motherfucking right, my pocket's looking kind of tight 
and I'm stressed, yo Biggie let me get the vest 
No need for that, just grab the fucking gat 
The first pocket that's fat the Tec is to his back 
Word is bond, I'm a smoke him yo don't fake no moves (what?) 
Treat it like boxing: stick and move, stick and move 
Nigga, you ain't got to explain shit 
I've been robbin motherfuckers since the slave ships 
with the same clip and the same four-five 
Two point-blank, a motherfucker's sure to die 
That's my word, nigga even try to bogart 
have his mother singing "It's so hard..." 
Yes, love love you're fucking attitude 
Because the nigga play pussy that's the nigga that's getting screwed 
And bruised up from the pistol whipping 
Webs on the neck from the necklace stripping 
Then I'm dipping up the block and I'm robbing bitches too 
Up the herring bones and bamboos 
I wouldn't give fuck if you're pregnant 
Give me the baby rings and a #1 MOM pendant 
I'm slamming niggaz like Shaquille, shit is real 
When it's time to eat a meal I rob and steal 
cause Mom Duke ain't giving me shit 
so for the bread and butter I leave niggaz in the gutter 
Huh, word to mother, I'm dangerous 
Crazier than a bag of fucking Angel Dust 
When I bust my gat motherfuckers take dirt naps 
I'm all that and a dime sack, where the paper at? 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up 
And I'm shooting niggaz quick if you hiccup 
Don't let me fill my clip up in your back and head piece 
The opposite of peace sending Mom Duke a wreath 
You're talking to the robbery expert 
Stepping to your wake with your blood on my shirt 
Don't be a jerk and get smoked over being resistant 
Cause when I lick shots the shits is persistent 
Huh, goodness gracious the papers 
Where the cash at? Where the stash at? 
Nigga, pass that before you get your grave dug 
from the main thug, .357 slug 
And my nigga Biggie got an itchy one grip 
One in the chamber, 32 in the clip 
Motherfuckers better strip, yeah nigga peel 
Before you find out how blue steel feel 
from the Beretta, putting all the holes in your sweater 
The money getter motherfuckers don't have better 
Rolex watches and colourful Swatches 
I'm digging in pockets, motherfuckers can't stop it 
Man, niggaz come through I'm taking high school rings too 
Bitches get *strangled* for they earrings and bangles 
And when I rock her and drop her I'm taking her door knockers 
And if she's resistant "baka! baka! baka!" 
So go get your man bitch he can get robbed too 
Tell him Biggie took it, what the fuck he gonna do? 
I hope apologetic or I'm a have to set it 
and if I set it the cocksucker won't forget it 
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot 
Man, listen all this walking is hurting my feet 
But money looks sweet (where at?) in the Isuzu jeep 
Man, I throw him in the Beem, you grab the fucking C.R.E.A.M 
And if he start to scream "bam! bam!", have a nice dream 
Hold up, he got a fucking bitch in the car 
Fur coats and diamonds, she thinks she a superstar 
Ooh Biggie, let me jack her, I kick her in the back 
Hit her with the gat... 
Yo chill, Shorty, let me do that 
Just get the fucking car keys and cruise up the block 
The bitch act shocked, gettin shot on the spot 
They ain't gonna roll up, all they want is fucking doughnuts 
I just came home, ain't trying to see Central Booking 
Oh shit, now he lookin in my face 
You better haul ass cause I ain't with no fucking chase 
So lace up your boots, cause I'm about to shoot 
A true motherfucker going out for the loot
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide 
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride 
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Do you, don't you want me to love you

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.
Well I gave you ev'rything I had,
But you left me sitting on my own,
Did you have to treat me oh so bad,
All I do is hang my head and moan.
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.
If there's something I have said or done,
Tell me what and I'll apologize,
If you don't really can't go on,
Holding back these tears in my eyes.
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me,
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.
Well I beg you on my bended knees,
If you'll only listen to my pleas,
Is there anything I can do,
'cause I really can't stand it, I'm so in love with you.
Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to me.
I saw her standing on the corner (Yip yip boom)
A yellow ribbon in her hair (Yip yip boom)
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured (Yip yip boom)
I tried to walk but I was lame (Yip yip boom)
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what's your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered (Yip yip boom)
I saw the rising of the sun (Yip yip boom)
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always
Thinkin' of you
Oh, ho, ho
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You've really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on, baby

Don't wanna kiss you
But I need to
Oh, ho, ho 
You do me wrong now
My love is strong now
You've really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on, baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Hold me
Tighter
Tighter 
I wanna leave you
Don't wanna too stay here
Don't wanna spend 
Another day here
Oh ho ho
I wanna split now
I just can't quit now
You've really got a hold on me 
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby

Hold me, please
Hold me, squeeze

I will prove to you
We will never be apart 
If I'm part of you
Open up your eyes now
Tell me what you see
It is no surprise now
What you see is me?
Big and black the clouds may be
Time will pass away
If you put your trust in me 
I'll make bright your day
Look into these eyes now
Tell me what you see
Don't you realise now
What you see is me?
Tell me what you see

And the stars 
Always shine
You'll be mine 
Oh 
My darling, when you brunt 
That toast the other morning 
I, I looked into you eyes and 
I could see that national health 
Eyball 
And I love you, like I never done
Like I never done before! 
Oh darling
In your eyes 
And you'll be mine 
You will be mine 
You'll be mine
And the star and so
You'll be mine
When I call you up 
Your line's engaged 
I have had enough 
So act your age 
We have lost the time 
That was so hard to find 
And I will lose my mind 
If you won't see me 
You won't see me
I don't know why you (Ooh-ooh)
Should want to hide (Ooh-ooh)
But I can't get through (Ooh-ooh)
My hands are tied (Ooh-ooh)
I won't want to stay (Ooh-ooh)
I don't have much to say (Ooh-ooh)
But I'd get turned away (Ooh-ooh)
And you won't see me
You won't see me
Time after time 
You refuse to even listen 
I wouldn't mind 
If I knew what I was missing (no, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)
Though the days are few (Ooooh)
They're filled with tears (Ooooh)
And since I lost you (Ooooh)
It feels like years (Ooooh)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooooh)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooooh)
And I just can't go on (Ooooh)
If you won't see me

You never give me your money 
You only give me your funny paper 
and in the middle of negotiations 
you break down 
I never give you my number 
I only give you my situation 
and in the middle of investigation 
I break down 
Out of college, money spent 
See no future, pay no rent 
All the money's gone, nowhere to go 
Any jobber got the sack 
Monday morning, turning back 
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go 
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go 
Oh, that magic feeling 
Nowhere to go 
One sweet dream 
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine 
Soon we'll be away from here 
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away 
One sweet dream came true today 
Came true today 
Came true today (yes it did) 
One two three four five six seven, 
All good children go to Heaven
Though you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know, it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know, it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me 
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I could't really stand it
I'd admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me 
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
Cause I could't really stand it

I wouldn't let you leave me cause it's true
Cause you like me too much and I like you
Cause you like me too much and I like you

I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus's garden in the shade 
He'd let us in, knows where we've been 
In his octopus's garden in the shade 
I'd ask my friends to come and see 
An octopus's garden with me 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus's garden in the shade. 
We would be warm below the storm 
In our little hideaway beneath the waves 
Resting our head on the sea bed 
In an octopus's garden near a cave 
We would sing and dance around 
because we know we can't be found 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus's garden in the shade 
We would shout and swim about 
The coral that lies beneath the waves 
Oh what joy for every girl and boy 
Knowing they're happy and they're safe 
We would be so happy you and me 
No one there to tell us what to do 
I'd like to be under the sea 
In an octopus's garden with you.

I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink 
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink 
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink 
No,no,no. 
I'm so tired I don't know what to do 
I'm so tired my mind is set on you 
I wonder should I call you but I know what you'd do 
You'd say I'm putting you on 
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm 
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain 
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane 
You know I'd give you everything I've got 
for a little peace of mind 
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset 
Although I'm so tired I'll have another cigarette 
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh 
He was such a stupid get.
Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you’re trying to steal the day

Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I’m trying to do my bit
I don’t expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get
I’m really sorry that you’re underfed
But like you heard me said:
Not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay
I won’t upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get
I’m really sorry that you’ve been misled
But like you heard me said:
Not guilty

Love to last more than one day

I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me. 
She showed me her room, isn't it good, norwegian wood? 
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere, 
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair. 
I sat on a rug, biding my time, drinking her wine. 
We talked until two and then she said "It's time for bed". 
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh. 
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath. 
And when I awoke I was alone, this bird had flown. 
So I lit a fire, isn't it good, norwegian wood?
Refren
Run and hit that pussy like a crash dummy
Bend it over, touch ya toes
Shake that ass for me

I asked her whats her name and she said her name Nicki
Got a real big booty and some real big titties

Cuz she a country girl and she like to get busy

I said "Ok" then shawty hit the flo'
And I was like "whoa"
Then I threw some 1s just to let shawty know
Just to let shawty that Ima

And that's a great feeling
And I fuck with her because she so willing
Watch her I do whatever that I tell her
So I broke her down and this is what I tell her
As I was slowly passing
An Orphan's home one day,
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play.
Alone a boy was standing,
And when I asked him why,
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child,
Just like the flowers
I am growing wild.
I've got no mammy's kisses,
I've got no, no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.
No mammy's arms to hold me
Or soothe me when I cry,
'Cause sometimes I feel so lonesome,
I wish that I colud die.
I'd walk the streets of heaven
Where all the blind can see,
And just like all other kids there'd be a home for me.
I'm nobody's child,
I'm nobody's child,
Just like the flowers
I am growing wild.
I've got no mammy's kisses,
I've got no, no daddy's smile.
Nobody wants me,
I'm nobody's child.
This happened once before, 
When I came to your door, 
No reply. 
They said it wasn't you, 
But I saw you peep through your window, 
I saw the light, I saw the light, 
I know that you saw me, 
'cause I looked up to see your face. 
I tried to telephone, 
They said you were not home, 
That's a lie, 
'cause I know where you've been, 
I saw you walk in your door, 
I nearly died, I nearly died, 
'cause you walked hand in hand 
With another man in my place. 
If I were you I'd realize that I 
Love you more than any other guy, 
And I'll forgive the lies that I 
Heard before when you gave me no reply. 
I've tried to telephone,

'cause you walked hand in hand 
With another man in my place. 
No reply, no reply.
When I see you I just dont know what to say
I'd like to be with you every hour of the day
So if you want me, just like I need you
You know what to do
I watched walking by and you looked alone
I hope that you won't mind if I walk you back home
But if you want me, just like I need you
You know what to do
Just call on me when you're lonely

Understand that I'll stay with you everyday
Make you love me more in everyway
So if you want me, just like I want you
You know what to do.
I'm findin' out what love is all about. 
And every day, at three, when school lets out
I see my baby I get weak in the knees. 
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
My pappy told me there'll be times like these
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to Rockin' Joe's
The cats are stomping on their heels and toes
I grab my baby, trying to give her a squeeze
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Well, why must she be such a doggone tease?
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spend my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and sun will shine
Till that time she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
Yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
She spend my money, then she plays me cruel
I'm begging for kisses on my bended knees
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin'
Baby, please, please, please?
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day, the wind will blow and sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees
There's nothing shaking, but the leaves on the trees

Long distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party

Only that I miss her

We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her

She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old

Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park 
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper 
Sleeps in a hole in the road 
Saving up to buy some clothes 
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose 
Such a mean old man 
Such a mean old man 
His sister Pam works in a shop 
She never stops, she's a go-getter 
Takes him out to look at the queen 
Only place that he's ever been 
Always shouts out something obscene 
Such a dirty old man 
Dirty old man
Born a poor young country boy--Mother Nature's son 
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone. 
Sit beside a mountain stream--see her waters rise 
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies. 
Find me in my field of grass--Mother Nature's son 
Swaying daises sing a lazy song beneath the sun. 
Mother Nature's son.
Joan was quizzical, studied pathophysical
Science in the home 
Late nights all alone with a test-tube 
Ohh-oh-oh-oh... 
Maxwell Edison majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone 
"Can I take you out to the pictures 
Joa-oa-oa-oan?" 
But as she's getting ready to go 
A knock comes on the door... 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that she was dead 
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again 
Teacher gets annoyed 
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene 
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away 
So he waits behind 
Writing 50 times "I must not be so-o-o-oo..." 
But when she turns her back on the boy 
He creeps up from behind 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon her head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that she was dead 
B.C. Thirty-One said "we caught a dirty one" 
Maxwell stands alone 
Painting testimonial pictures ohh-oh-oh-oh 
Rose and Valerie screaming from the gallery 
Say he must go free (Maxwell must go free) 
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-oo 
But as the words are leaving his lips 
A noise comes from behind 
Bang, bang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Came down upon his head 
Clang, clang, Maxwell's silver hammer 
Made sure that he was dead
She wrote me only one sad night
Told me she's no longer mine
Shoo shoo mailman, that will do for sometime
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues
One more heartache is all I can use
Mailman, bring me no more blues
Mailman, bring me no more blues [fade out]

Oh dirty Maggie Mae, they have taking her away
And she'll never walk down Lisle St. anymore.
Oh the judge he guilty found her
For robbin' the homeward bounder,
That dirty no-good robbin' Maggie Mae.
'Tis the part of Liverpool she returned me to,
Two pound ten a week there was my pay.
Picture yourself in a boat on a river, 
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies 
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly, 
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes. 
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, 
Towering over your head. 
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes, 
And she's gone. 
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain 
Where rocking horse people eat marshmellow pies, 
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers, 
That grow so incredibly high. 
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore, 
Waiting to take you away. 
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds, 
And you're gone. 
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...
Picture yourself on a train in a station, 
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties, 
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstyle, 
The girl with the kaleidoscope eyes. 
Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...
Lucille, baby do your sister's will
Lucille, baby do your sister's will
Well you ran off and married
But I love you still
Lucille, baby satisfy my soul
Lucille, baby satisfy my soul
Well you know I love you baby
I'll never let you go
Well I woke up this morning
Lucille was not in sight
I asked her friends about her
But all their lips were tight
Lucille, please come back where you belong
Well I'm talking to you baby
I'll never do you wrong
Well Lucille, baby do your sister's will
Ooh Lucille, yeah baby do your sister's will
Well you ran off and married
But I love you still
Lovely Rita meter maid, lovely Rita meter maid. 
Lovely Rita meter maid. 
Nothing can come between us, 
When it gets dark I tow your heart away. 
Standing by a parking meter, 
When I caught a glimpse of Rita, 
Filling in a ticket in her little white book. 
In a cap she looked much older, 
And the bag across her shoulder 
Made her look a little like a military man. 
Lovely Rita meter maid, 
May I inquire discreetly, 
When are you free, 
To take some tea with me. 
Took her out and tried to win her, 
Had a laugh and over dinner, 
Told her I would really like to see her again, 
Got the bill and Rita paid it, 
Took her home I nearly made it, 
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two. 
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid, 
Where would I be without you, 
Give us a wink and make me think of you.
Lovely Rita meter maid, lovely Rita meter maid. 
Lovely Rita meter maid, lovely Rita meter maid.
Yo, I've been rhyming since my daddy's dick first got wet
Kicked a hole in the womb of my mother then I jet
Back to the scene of the crime
A true mastermind
I'll never do time
Nah, but I do watch my watch till the second hand stops
And the bars close down and the records get dropped
Piss drunk in the parking lot speaking dumb
Gun all sticky from the Puerto Rican rum
I keep it real like the 80's when we flooded the block
Stick up kids went from baseheads to suckin' the cock
The hottest bitch in my projects discovered the rock
A year later had the monster climbing out of her twat
This is a stick up
I told you you could reach for the sky
Fuck a chip off the brick or the piece of the pie
The worst thing they did to the kid was leave him alive
Now I'm ruthless moving with a reason to die
The trees got me so high kid sniff your next line
My culture's refined
I'm heavy on the grind
I'm hard in the paint
My uzi weighs a kilo
I'll smack you in the face and crack your head like Cee Lo
It's a fact homey eagles don't roam in flocks
But the eagles that I got will put a hole in your top
So predictable I'm already knowin' your plot
It happens so fast you won't even know that you're shot
Till the concrete is painted with pain
Cause you bein' dead is the only way they'll ever say you were slain
Black scully, black bandana, and black coat
with the co-leader in the House of Pain (that's coke)
You already know what it is
It's the pimp, the sniff and the aw shit
That ain't dandruff homeboy
Hell naw that ain't dandruff
All in together now - That's coke (x5)
That's coke in freezer bags hidden in the ferarri
More raw than Big Daddy Kane spittin' with Marley
More white than them three bitches sniffin' with Charley
That's coke like a boston george new year's party
The motherfuckin' svengali
Mob boss got body in the XL Denali
With the mossberg shotty
Got a full box of shells and a ransom note
That ain't gun powder out on my dash (that's coke)
I'm raw as sushi
Belushi's spirit probably is with me
I'm Rick James bitch, ask Bobby and Whitney
In the hood where the maniacs will rob you to get me
Gettin' blown by Paris, Nicole, Lindsey, and Brittney
You shittin' me?
I go 0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0 to 100, nigga, real quick
Real quick, real fuckin' quick, nigga
I'll run my blade across a nigga ass (real quick)
I'm so for real I'm on some real, real nigga shit
You playing, boy, I'll get you hit (real quick)
You better hope the parademics come (real quick)
Got me fucked up if you thinking it's different now a nigga rich
Before I get to cutting know you niggas better cut the shit
Boy, you gon have [?] popped, pull a trigger for me
And my little niggas trigger op like it's legal, homie
No game when I bang, boy, I empty the clip
You run like a bitch, you ain't 'bout that shit
Hey, hey, hey, I'll catch you another day, day, day
It's the Unit back to the bullshit
Nothing in life is out of bounds
AK hold about a hundred rounds
60 shots like KD at the Rucker's
Okay when I see you on respirators
Southside nigga 'til the day I'm gone
Indulge in the violence when the drama on
Yeah, these rap niggas lukewarm
I'm too sleaves of dope when the mic on
Don't Tweet me, see me when you see me
Down to make the news just to say that I'm on TV
This clip rated R, niggas PG
Them shells burn like a bootleg CD
Fuck love, I want the money
When you get too much of it they gon' say you acting funny
''Kidd, how you feel now that the Unit's back?''
Like a million bucks, motherfucker, do the math
Coldblooded, boy, my heart don't feel shit
Get with me, ask 50, I take the hit (real quick)
Balenciagas you could still get your ass kicked
Take a rapper nigga bitch and make a real flick
I know I'm different from what you usually been dealing with
Don't need a mic, give me some white to make a million with
Single burrough, 6 shots on the Brooklyn Bridge
I let the nigga Drake tell you what I just did
Nigga, getting money new to you
I give a fuck if shit get ugly, it'll be a beautiful funeral
You fit the script I'm gon' assume it's true
Can't manuever through the street without a strategy
Ain't nobody to tutor you
And man was lucky Unit's through
You know how he flows
15 years switching dealers like casinos
And my goon'll clip you in the arm
I'm out the country every week and dumping ash on the Autobahn
Autopilot's always on, rather bet a living, I've been [?]
Greenbills calling me all day long, this is homocide
More tears in your mama eyes
More reasons to wake up, real niggas arrive
Kevin Gates, 
I'm everybody sworn favorite
People tend to feel 
I'm Micheal Jackson reincarnated
Satellites, never really made love
Alright
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, 
But she gon' get it right
Emotions probably telling her 
She could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, 
They don't give her good advice
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love
Say she never really made love
I've been shot through the heart
Just on the d-low, 
Lucas Brasi selling kilos
Gotta shop outta town and 
Got a spot just around the way
Let's be specific, 
If I'm the nigga you feeling
Am I wrong for showing interest 
In these women surrounding
I'mma straight dick her down and go
No time to lounge with hoes
On the grind, all the time
I done been down this road
Strictly need my c-notes, 
Can you keep up with my lingo
Some'll say life is a gamble, 
Which means love is a casino
Everybody just playin' to win, 
Think I made again
Though many ladies pretend, 
Hoping this ain't what it is
This business I'm in, 
May make me taking a beating
Would you still be my friend, 
When I'm lonely love
Get 'em gone, cause ain't no one 
On the phone, but us
Someone who strong when it's rough, 
Someone who won't give up
Ain't no wasting time, hustle every night
Promise everything is alright
Satellites, satellites
Never really made love, 
But she gon' get it right

She could stay the night
But her friends all call us crazy, 
They don't give her good advice

Never really made love, Gates
Never really made love

People changing on me, 
I am so sick of the masquerades
Grew up poor, had no dishes, 
Ate off paper plates
I'm taking aim, brought up 
In this life I know
Baby you a rider and 
I love when you ride it slow
Motion for me girl
Arch it to the ceiling, 
Now bend over for me girl
Pulling on your hair, while 
I'm gripping on your ass
When I kill it from the back, 
Know you feel it in your back
Late night screaming, 
All of the right reasons
Touching, teasing, 
Blowing it might please
Make it bite back, 
I love when it bite me
Saying take some out, 
I know what it might be
When your body go to shaking, 
You're raising your right knee
Bit the pillow with your teeth, 
I know what it might mean
I'mma keep going, 
I know that the light green
Can't stay still, 
I'm stroking the right thing
Climb in the bed, 
With a dime in the bed
Don't tell me the spot, 
I'mma find it instead
Big fine muthafucka, 
She a dime with the head
Just got a text, never mind what it said
IPhone ringing, I decline with a fret
Which color should 
I press, lime or the red
Decline or accept, 
Next line never read
Minus the time and 
The time been the best
Told her what it was first time that we met
But she cry and get upset every time that I left
Satellites, satellites

Yesterday 
All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly 
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go?
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong?
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday 
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away

If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is the color that my baby wore
And what's more it's true
Yes it is
Scarlet were the clothes she wore
Everybody knows I'm sure
I would remember all the things we planned
Understand it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is, yeah
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
In spite of you it's true
Yes it is, it's true

I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, yes it is, oh yes it is, yeah

Yes I'm lonely wanna die 
If I ain't dead already 
Ooh girl you know the reason why. 
In the morning wanna die 
In the evening wanna die 
If I ain't dead already 
Ooh girl you know the reason why. 
My mother was of the sky 
My father was of the earth 
But I am of the universe 
And you know what it's worth 
I'm lonely wanna die 
If I ain't dead already 
Ooh girl you know the reason why. 
The eagle picks my eye 
The worm he licks my bone 
I feel so suicidal 
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones 
Lonely wanna die 
If I ain't dead already 
Ooh girl you know the reason why. 
Black cloud crossed my mind 
Blue mist round my soul 
Feel so suicidal 
Even hate my rock and roll 
Wanna die yeah wanna die 
If I ain't dead already 
Ooh girl you know the reason why.
"Yellow Submarine"
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed up to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
[Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead
Full speed ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable, drop the cable
Aye, Sir, aye
Captain, captain] 
As we live a life of ease (A life of ease)
Everyone of us (Everyone of us) has all we need (Has all we need)
Sky of blue (Sky of blue) and sea of green (Sea of green)
In our yellow (In our yellow) submarine (Submarine, ha, ha)
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine

Darling I love you

Darling when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling I love you
We were talking - about the space between us all
And the people - who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion.
Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late -
When they pass away.
We were talking - about the love we all could share -
When we find it to try our best to hold it there -
With our love, with our love - we could save the world -
If they only knew.
Try to realize it's all within yourself no -
one else can make you change,
And to see you're really only very small,
and life flows on within you and without you.
We were talking - about the love that's gone so cold
And the people, who gain the world and lose their soul -
They don't know - they can't see -
Are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself - then you
may find, peace of mind is waiting there -
And the time will come when you see
we're all one, and life flows on
within you and without you.
Billy Shears! 
What would you think if I sang out of tune? 
Would you stand up and walk out on me? 
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
and I'll try not to sing out of key
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
What do I do when my love is away? 
Does it worry you to be alone? 
How do I feel by the end of the day? 
Are you sad because you're on your own? 
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody? 
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody? 
I want somebody to love
Would you belive in a love at first sight? 
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light? 
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends
Do you need anybody?

Honey pie, honey pie
Honey pie, honey pie
Honey pie, honey pie
Honey pie, honey pie
I love you honey pie
Here I stand head in hands 
Turned my face to the wall 
If she's gone I can't go on 
Feeling two foot small 
Everywhere people stare 
Each and every day 
I can see them laugh at me 
And I hear them say 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away 
How can I even try?
I can never win 
Hearing them, seeing them 
In the state I'm in 
How could she say to me 
Love will find a way?
Gather round, all you clowns 
Let me hear you say 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away 
Hey, you've got to hide your love away

Baby, won't you tell me
Why, why, why, why are we so far apart?
Why, why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me again?
I just want your lovin' arms about me, yeah
I've gotta find a way to make you take me back
Babym won't you tell me
Why, why, why, why are we so far apart?
Why, why don't you open your heart?
If you only knew how much I love you
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me
Why can't you love me again?
When I get older losing my hair, 
Many years from now. 
Will you still be sending me a valentine 
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine. 
If I'd been out till quarter to three 
Would you lock the door, 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, 
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too, 
And if you say the word, 
I could stay with you. 
I could be handy, mending a fuse 
When your lights have gone. 
You can knit a sweater by the fireside 
Sunday mornings go for a ride, 
Doing the garden, digging the weeds, 
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, 
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage, 
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear 
We shall scrimp and save 
Grandchildren on your knee 
Vera, Chuck & Dave. 
Send me a postcard, drop me a line, 
Stating point of view 
Indicate precisely what you mean to say 
Yours sincerely, wasting away 
Give me your answer, fill in a form 
Mine for evermore 
Will you still need me, will you still feed me, 
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
Come on, out of my way,
'cause I'm gonna see my baby today,
I've got a whole lot of things I've gotta say
To her.
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
Come on if you please,
I've got no time for trivialities,
I've got a girl who's waiting home for me tonight.
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I got a whole lot of things to tell her,
When I get home.
When I'm getting home tonight, I'm gonna
Hold her tight.
I'm gonna love her till the cows come home,
I bet I'll love her more,
Till I walk out that door
Again.
Come on, let me through,
I've got so many things, I've got to do,
I've got no business being here with you
This way.
Whoa-ho, whoa-ho,
I've got a whole lot of things to tell her
When I get home - yeah.
I look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you how to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you.
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you. 
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping/
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all.../
Still my guitar gently weeps
I look from the wings at the play you are staging 
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps
Hey mama don't you see me wrong
I come and love you daddy all night long
Alright hey hey hey hey
See the gal with the diamond ring
She knows how to shake that thing
Alright hey hey hey hey (play the thing)
See the gal with the red dress on
She knows how to do it all night long
Alright hey hey hey hey
Well tell your mama, tell your pa
Gonna send you back to Arkansas
Alright hey hey don't do it right now
When you see me in misery
Well you see me in misery
Well baby save my fee
Alright hey hey hey hey
Oh tell me what'd say
Tell me what'd I say...
Look what you're doing,
I'm feeling blue nad lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running
And there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
I've been waiting here for you,
Wondering what you're gonna do.
And should you need a love that's true, it's me.
Please stop your lying,
You've got me crying, girl
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?

I'm sweating balls.
I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Coogi down to the socks like I'm Biggie poppa
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho
Cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though
All she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical
Bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window
So you see a nigga shining in the Benzo
Balling! Got me feelin' like Jim Jones, I'm a pimp though
No limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the buildin', semi gon' squirt
That's what a nigga get when they getting on my nerves
I ain't lying, lay 'em on the curb
Riding on a killer who be coming at Ferg! (Damn)
Girl you twerk, twerk that kitty girl make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel he gon' put him in the earth
Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work
Schoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth
Polo Ground, A$AP World
Loose cannon, he shot me so I had to do it
Put him in the dirt, put him in it first
I just sold a swammy with ten hommies on it
Her ass fat, you could park ten Tahoes on it
When they mask up, comin' for your ice
When they bare-faced, they comin for your life
Baby don't pray for me pray for the weak
I'm drinkin' lean, it help me sleep
Illuminati? I'm from the streets
Never sold my body, we takin' bodies
Put in work, put in work
Put in work, put 'em in the dirt
Shout out that motherland, 12 years old with guns in hand
They don't ask no questions, nigga, all they do is bang bang bang
They don't ask no questions, all they do is bang bang
I said I do this for them shottas, Trinidad I love ya
I do this for them shottas, Jamaica I'm your brother
I know a bitch from VI, yeah yeah yeah that's my partner
You got a problem with it, then, then, then, then that's your problem
I fuck with Asian niggas And I fuck with Migos
I fuck with Haitian niggas, all they speak is Creole
I said all I speak is real, y'all niggas might hate me but
That don't get no deal, I said no that don't get no deal
I just now got my deal, but I been gettin' this money
No green card in this struggle, immigration give you nothing but work
Yawk, Yawk, Yawk, Yawk!
A lotta niggas died, should've been from Hoover Street
No I do not have a car, but I could buy one every week
Pimpin' like I'm 33, move keys like I'm 36
Ship O's like I'm 28, Tacoma know I'm pushin' weight
O-X-Y I'm in your state, eatin' off your dinner plate
My heart live where Santa stay, super fly, I need a cape
Bitches throwin' pussy back and forth, they on my dick
Passion drippin' off her lip, she say she never had a crip
Uh, put in work, all big booties make ya twerk
All big titties lift your shirt, show a player what you're worth
Yeah, put in work, spray his ass in front the Church
Deacon said I did my shit, the pastor said, "That nigga turnt"
Pop my collar on my shirt, make these bitches go berserk
Shippin' units, Captain Kirk, takin' xannies poppin' percs
Might not last, I'll bomb ya first, turn your backseat to a hearse
Back to the lab with mother Earth, had to give Young Ferg a verse
A lot of homies cried, due to crimes, homicide
Drivin' by, poppin' nines, Pakistan, Columbine
Out of line, pistols barkin' "Ar, ar" ride or die
Write a script, design a line, all I see is dollar signs
You want that pretty Flacko? Ratchets, designer jackets
The same niggas who jack it be the first who claim we faggots
My bitch is a movie actress, side bitch won a beauty pageant
Got a chick that worked at Magic
But I'm so damn fine make a bitch look average
See my daddy in heaven, right next to Ferg's
You know what's up I'm throwin' bucks, Loaded Lux, put in work
Inaczej patrzy pedał, inaczej dobry chłopak
Inny wzrok ma biedak, inne spojrzenie bogacz
Czasami wiesz, że trzeba od razu reagować
Czasami z dziewczynami wieczorami bez słowa
Kss...kss...i oczy mówią wszystko
Czujesz wzrok na sobie? - Bóg jest blisko
Nie masz szans, nie znikniesz nawet w tłumie
... patrz po oczach, rozumiesz?
Na krawężnikach, na dachach i ulicach
Tysiące ludzi, każdy nowy wieczór wita
Warszawa kiedyś, albo Hawana dzisiaj
Bez pośpiechu państwowy styl życia
Inne mają oczy uśmiechnięci na pocztówkach
Inne mają młodzi w stuningowanych maluchach
Cii...cii...nie mów mi czego tu szukasz
Po wzroku nauczyłem się prawdziwych odróżniać

I said I'm sitting here watching
A matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wandering
A matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go
I'm a lone poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I'm a lone poor boy
And I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
Cause everything I ever did was wrong
Ohhh if you don't want my peaches honey
Please don't shake my tree
If you don't won't to pick those my peaches honey
Please don't mess around with my tree
I've got news for you baby
Leave you here in misery
All right...
Well, i'll be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
Till your big dog comes
When your big dog gets here watch
How your puppy dog will be gone
I said I'm sitting here watching
A matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here watching
A matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
But I sure got a long way to go.

The game of chess, is like a swordfight
You must think first, before you move
Toad style is immensely strong, and immune to nearly any weapon
When it's properly used, it's almost invincible
Raw I'ma give it to ya, with no trivia
Raw like cocaine straight from Bolivia
My hip-hop will rock and shock the nation
like the Emancipation Proclamation
Weak MC's approach with slang that's dead
you might as well run into the wall and bang your head
I'm pushin' force, my force your doubtin'
I'm makin' devils cower to the Caucus Mountains
Well I'm a sire, I set the microphone on fire
Rap styles vary, and carry like Mariah
I come from the Shaolin slum, and the isle I'm from
is comin through with nuff niggaz, and nuff guns
so if you wanna come sweatin, stressin contestin
you'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggaz are outlined in chalk
A man vexed, is what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin niggaz like a eighteen wheeler
with the drunk driver drivin, there's no survivin
Ruff like Timberland wear, yeah
Me and the Clan, and yo the Landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks, all the niggaz with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We got chrome tecs, nickel plated macs
Black axe, drug dealin styles in phat stacks

I guess I would die, sweetheart
If I don't get a kiss from you
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die
Oh, if you want me, baby
You've gotta come to me
Mm, I'm just like a stump in a field
You just can't move me
Take out some insurance on me, baby
Ooh, some insurance on me, baby
Well, if you ever, ever say goodbye
I'm gonna go right home and die

If you ever, ever say goodbye

My tears are fallin' cause you've taken her away
And through it really hurts me so
There's something that I gotta say
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Ah, take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint a rainbow all around her
Don't let her see a cloudy sky
Once upon a time that little girl was mine
If I'd been true I know she'd never be with you 
So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Ah, take good care of my baby, 
Take good care of my baby... 
Ooh...
They're really rocking in Boston,
In Philadelphia PA,
Deep in the heart of Texas,
On down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis
And down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen.
Sweet little sixteen,
She's just got to have
About half a million
Framed autopraphs.
Her wall is filled with pictures,
She gets them one by one.
Becomes so excited,
Oh watch her at the run boy.
Oh mommy mommy,
Please may I go.
You know it's such a sight to see
Somebody steal the show.
Oh daddy daddy,
I beg of you.
Please say it to mommy
It's alright with you.
Sweet little sixteen
She's got the grown up blues.
Tight dresses and lipstick,
She's sporting in high heeled boots.
Oh but tomorrow morning
She'll have to change her trend
Become sweet sixteen
And back in class again.
They're really rocking in Boston,
In Philadelphia PA,
Deep in the heart of Texas
And down the Frisco Bay.
All over Saint Louis,
On down in New Orleans.
All the cats want to dance with
Sweet little sixteen.
Ha, yeah. I know what you're all thinking 
That this is some old Janet Jackson type of shit! 
but it ain't about that 
This if the real, the street life trauma 
Yo, I grew up rough in the streets of Boston, Massachusetts 
Lived real ruthless, a wild kid, out to get a bid 
Did some shit! that he never shoulda did 
But he payed da price, lived real trife
Ruined his life, and lived by the knife....
Had ta learn da hard way..but some day u gotta pay so wat da hell..
Life in the streets ain't easy 
All I see is pain and misery 
I kneel and pray for the betrayed 
Strength and protection to survive in the society 
This is the life in the streets 
And that's how we live it 
Hard and mean at sixteen, livin' like a beam, theme 
Out scheming for the green 
Quick to kill, I gets ill, I make ya blood spill 
I cut ya throat for your goose-down coat 
Cuz statistic show that kids with no dough 
ain't got no chance, got nowhere to go 
That's why life on the streets is like a trifular beat 
It'll echo in ya head till you're dead on the concrete 
Life in the streets is a mystery 
Don't know my friends from my enemies 
Up to lot, could be trouble 
But I'll hold tight and I will never give up the fight 
This one is dedicated to all the homeless people 
to every youth that's growin' up on the streets 
You know, we're living for a dream one day 
that there'll be no more homeless people in the world 
Life in the streets is not easy
Well, come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
Said: come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
When you get on Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
I said: come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
I said: come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
Yeah, you come to Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
Go Suzy Go! (rattatatatatatatatatata...)
When you get on Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
Yeah, come on Suzy Parker, everybody's welcome to come
I said: come on Suzy Parker everybody's welcome to come
When you get to Suzy Parker, everybody gets well done
Said: go little Suzy (rattatatatatatatatata...)
Said: go little Suzy (rattatatatatatatatata...)
Go little Suzy: everybody gets well done
I'm sure to fall, fall in love
I'm sure to fall in love with you
You are so sweet and so near
I'm sure to fall in love with you
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling don't ever let me go
Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life
So hold me tight
Let tonight be the night
Darling don't ever let me go
Loving you is the natural thing to do
I want you for the rest of my life

Let me take you down,
‘Cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see.
It’s getting hard to be someone.
But it all works out,
It doesn’t matter much to me.
Let me take you down,
‘Cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
No one I think is in my tree,
I mean it must be high or low.
That is you can’t you know tune in.
But it’s all right.
That is I think it’s not too bad.
Let me take you down,
‘Cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Always, no sometimes, I think it’s me,
But you know I know and it’s a dream.
I think I know I mean a ‘Yes’.
But it’s all wrong.
That is I think I disagree.
Let me take you down,
‘Cause I’m going to Strawberry Fields.
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about.
Strawberry Fields forever.
Strawberry Fields forever.
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out; find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have a long lifetime
Get out of sour milk sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there
Get out of sour milk sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Looking for release from limitation?
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings result
Get out of sour milk sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there.
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

I said, "Who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born."
She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no you're wrong
When I was a boy
Everything was right
Evrything was right."

She said, "You don't understand what I said."
I said, "No, no, no you're wrong
When I was a boy
Everything was right
Evrything was right."

I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born."

One sunny day the world was waiting for a lover 
She came along to turn on everyone 
Sexy Sadie the greatest of them all. 
Sexy Sadie how did you know 
The world was waiting just for you 
The world was waiting just for you 
Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know. 
Sexy Sadie you'll get yours yet 
However big you think you are

Just a smile would lighten everything 
Sexy Sadie she's the latest and the greatest of them all. 
She made a fool of everyone 
Sexy Sadie. 
However big you think you are 
Sexy Sadie.
Wednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes downstairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside she is free.
She (We gave her most of our lives)
Is leaving (Sacrificed most of our lives)
Home (We gave her everything money could buy)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye.
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown.
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband "Daddy our baby's gone".
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me.
She (We never thought of ourselves)
Is leaving (Never a thought of ourselves)
Home (We struggled hard all our lives to get by)
She's leaving home after living alone
For so many years. Bye, bye.
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade.
She (What did we do that was wrong)
Is having (We didn't know it was wrong)
Fun (Fun is the one thing that money can't buy)
Something inside that was always denied
For so many years. Bye, Bye
She's leaving home bye bye.
It’s been a long day 
Ooh.. but the city waits 
It’ll come to you, come to you if you don’t hesitate 
And in a lot of ways 
I know I am to blame 
Because I run to you, run to you, run to you all the way 
And you know.. 
Got a feeling so high 
You’re held against the times 
We can chase the night divine 
And I say 
You’re feeling so high 
All the sweet & better times 
We could chase the night divine 
I’m feeling tongue-tied 
Ooh.. and I don’t know why 
I can’t come to you, come to you, come to you this time 
And what I had in mind 
Ooh.. is something on the lines 
Running back to you, back to you, back to you in my time 
And you know.. 
Feeling so high 
You’re held against the times 
We can chase the night divine 
You’re feeling so high 
Sweet & better times 
We could chase the night divine

She came in through the bathroom window 
Protected by a silver spoon 
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders 
By the banks of her own lagoon 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
She said she'd always been a dancer 
She worked at 15 clubs a day 
And though she thought I knew the answer 
Well I knew what I could not say. 
And so I quit the police department 
And got myself a steady job 
And though she tried her best to help me 
She could steal but she could not rob 
Didn't anybody tell her? 
Didn't anybody see? 
Sunday's on the phone to Monday, 
Tuesday's on the phone to me 
Oh yeah.

Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart 
A coffee dessert--yes you know it's good news 
But you'll have to have them all pulled out 
After the Savoy truffle. 
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart 
I feel your taste all the time we're apart 
Coconut fudge--really blows down those blues 
But you'll have to have them all pulled out 
After the Savoy truffle. 
You might not feel it now 
But when the pain cuts through 
You're going to know and how 
The sweat is going to fill your head 
When it becomes too much 
You're going to shout aloud 
--Creme tangerine. 
You know that what you eat you are, 
But what is sweet now, turns so sour-- 
We all know Obla-Di-Bla-Da 
But can you show me, where you are?.. 
Creme tangerine and montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart 
A coffee dessert--yes you know its good news 
But you'll have to have them all pulled out 
After the Savoy truffle.
Well, I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl

You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man,

Well, you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life tryin'
Just to make you tow the line

Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said

That I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand, little girl
Catch you with another man

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a black beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too damn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a black beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my lover on over 'cross the tracks
So she can hear my man wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man, they were blowin' like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a black beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Those Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinkin' home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancin' got all shook up
And started playin' that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a black beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
I'm in the mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for a congo
So keep on rockin' that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a black beat, you can't blues it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me. 
If you wanna dance with me

Home safely to me
All my little plans and schemes, 
Lost like some forgotten dreams. 
Seems that all I really was doing 
Was waiting for you. 
Just like little girls and boys 
Playing with their little toys, 
Seems like all they really were doing 
Was waiting for love. 
Don't need to be alone. 
No need to be alone. 
It's real love. 
It's real. 
Yes, it's real love. 
It's real. 
From this moment on I know 
Exactly where my life will go. 
Seems that all I really was doing 
Was waiting for love. 
Don't need to be afraid. 
No need to be afraid. 
It's real love. 
It's real. 
Yes, it's real love. 
It's real. 
Thought I'd been in love before, 
But in my heart I wanted more. 
Seems like all I really was doing 
Was waiting for you. 
Don't need to be alone. 
Don't need to be alone. 
It's real love. 
It's real. 
It's real love. 
It's real. 
Yes, it's real love. 
It's real. 
It's real love. 
It's real.
Now somewhere in the black mountain hills of Dakota 
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon 
And one day his woman ran off with another guy 
Hit young Rocky in the eye Rocky didn't like that 
He said I'm gonna get that boy 
So one day he walked into town 
Booked himself a room in the local saloon. 
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room 
Only to find Gideon's bible 
Rocky had come equipped with a gun 
To shoot off the legs of his rival 
His rival it seems had broken his dreams 
By stealing the girl of his fancy. 
Her name was Magil and she called herself Lil 
But everyone knew her as Nancy. 
Now she and her man who called himself Dan 
Were in the next room at the hoe down 
Rocky burst in and grinning a grin 
He said Danny boy this is a showdown 
But Daniel was hot-he drew first and shot 
And Rocky collapsed in the corner. 
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin 
And proceeded to lie on the table 
He said Rocky you met your match 
And Rocky said, Doc it's only a scratch 
And I'll be better I'll be better doc as soon as I am able. 
Now Rocky Raccoon he fell back in his room 
Only to find Gideon's bible 
Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt 
To help with good Rocky's revival.
Well you should see Polythene Pam 
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man 
Well you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag 
Yes you should see Polythene Pam. 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt 
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt 
She's the kind of a girl that makes the "News of the World" 
Yes you could say she was attractively built. 
Yeah yeah yeah.
"Please Please Me"

Have you seen the little piggies 
Crawling in the dirt 
And for all the little piggies 
Life is getting worse 
Always having dirt to play around in. 
Have you seen the bigger piggies 
In their starched white shirts 
You will find the bigger piggies 
Stirring up the dirt 
Always have clean shirts to play around in. 
In their styes with all their backing 
They don't care what goes on around 
In their eyes there's something lacking 
What they need's a damn good whacking. 
Everywhere there's lots of piggies 
Living piggy lives 
You can see them out for dinner 
With their piggy wives 
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon.
In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs 
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know. 
And all the people that come and go 
Stop and say hello. 
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, 
The little children laugh at him behind his back. 
And the banker never wears a mac 
In the pouring rain, very strange. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back 
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass 
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. 
He likes to keep his fire engine clean, 
It's a clean machine. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
A four of fish and finger pies 
In summer, meanwhile back 
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout 
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray 
And tho' she feels as if she's in a play 
She is anyway. 
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, 
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim. 
And then the fireman rushes in 
From the pouring rain, very strange. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies 
I sit, and meanwhile back. 
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. 
There beneath the blue suburban skies, 
Penny Lane.

If you're listening to this song 
You may think the chords are going wrong 
But they're not; 
He just wrote it like that. 
When you're listening late at night 
You may think the band are not quite right 
But they are, they just play it like that 
It doesn't really matter what chords I play 
What words I say or time of day it is 
As it's only a Northern song. 
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear 
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown 
As it's only a Northern song. 
If you think the harmony 
Is a little dark and out of key 
You're correct, there's nobody there. 
And I told you there's no one there.
My baby says she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the one after 909
I begged her not to go and I begged her on my bended knee
You're only fooling around, you're only fooling around with me
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the one after 909
I've got my bag
Run to the station
Railman says
You've got the wrong location
I've got my bag
Run right home
Then I find
I've got the number wrong
I said I'm travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the one after 909
I've got my bag
Run to the station
Railman said
You've got the wrong location
I've got my bag
Run right home
Then I find
I've got the number wrong
My baby says she's travelling on the one after 909
I said move over honey I'm travelling on that line
I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice
I said I'm travelling on the one after 909.

I want a love that's right but right is only half of what's wrong. 
I want a short haired girl who sometimes wears it twice as ong. 
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe, baby, I'm in love with you. 
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now, I'm telling you. 
You know you pick me up from where some try to drag me down 
And when I see your smile replace every thoughtless frown. 
Got me escaping from this zoo, baby, I'm in love with you. 
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you. 
If I grow up I'll be a singer wearing rings on every finger. 
Not worrying what they or you say I'll live and love and maybe someday 
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me. 
I may appear to be imperfect, my love is something you can't reject. 
I'm changing faster than the weather if you and me should get together 
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me. 
That love of your, to miss that love is something I'd hate. 
I'll make an early start, I'm making sure that I'm not late. 
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue, baby, I'm in love ith you. 
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you. 
I'm so glad you came here, it won't be the same now when I'm with you.

I'm raining fire like apache helicopters
Prepare for the worst we comin' thunderin' opposition wonderin'
How they get the drop on us we set up and lock corners try to put
We fight together we ride together..
Prepare for the worst we comin' thunderin' opposition wonderin'
How they get the drop on us we set up and lock corners try to put
A stop on us we react so quick the 5o couldn't even call the cops on us
Steady put the rocks on us but my chain stay still, still my name
Stay real spit the flame they feel I no the game take skill that why
The brains stay ill we 'bout to change the deal keep the champagne
Chilled we sippin'? With a molly rose y'all belly meatin' beef and
Nothing but bologna foes your phony flows we stopping rise own
The own the game y'all is leasing with the option to buy your flight been
Delayed kid you not gonna fly we got the army throw your hands
To the sky this is chain gang bitch, don't bother to check us y'all
Don't got to like us but you gon respect us motherfucker
We fight together we ride together..
Listen baby I'm just tryin' to eat it's the same game that put
Chain gang in the street got goons with a few hundred clips
In the heat it's the same sex violence and money dyin' to meat
Goddamn I'm a fan it's music move me I found writhing rhymes
Was soothing don't lose me never let the truth allude me the skills
I respect I expect you Dolly some got gifts man but reflect it crudely
That why I keep it real like rejected movies what now and no what was
Or would be only sing along if you understood me the seen hip hop
Dawg ain't were it could be trademark will take y'all right where
It should be you actors that's where it stops you stars on stage
Y'all adecrative props what now
We fight together we ride together...
Look man my voice Cristen in beats your vision see ripples
On concrete for glisten heat whenever I speak I walk streets?
Trademarc John Cena Freddie fox and Rup corrupt mob
The chain gang spittin' the same slang let the iron go bang bang
And came man let the church bells ring ring to all y'all coppin'
The lot let it hang hang
Y'all think we lucky that ain't nothin' new to me 'cause
Luck is preparation lockin' heads with opportunity
So far I just had to listen and learn play my position and earn
With the vision and burn, now the shit is all turned and I'm
Reppin' for pride where I'm from you either step up or step aside
Want some get some stop drop and parallel chain gang run this bitch
Lock stock and barrel
We fight together we ride together.
We fight together we ride together
Right now we gonna to get loud together
Chain gang is the click
Keine Gnade, keine Rücksicht (wooh)
Wenn eine Grade dein Gesicht trifft (pah)
Wir machen Para mit mei'm Business (hih)
Alles andre intressiert nicht (na)
Gazo war niemals ein Drückeberger (na)
Weil das, was ich tu', mich zum Millionär macht (tsching)
Sitz' im Porsche, sitz' im Mercer
Und komm' ich vorbei, Digga, wird es schmerzhaft
Drück' die Patrone, mach's Magazin voll (yes)
Die Leute in Deutschland, sie kennen mein'n Ruf (ja)
Ich rede nicht, denn wenn die Schnacker Beef woll'n
Sind sechzehn Freunde viel schneller als du
Ich hab' es so gewollt, man hat immer 'ne Wahl (immer)
Drogen verpackt in mei'm Kinderzimmer
Kopf durch die Wand, so wie Zidane
Und in dein'n Hals wird 'ne Klinge gerammt (zack)
CL 500 Facelift
Hab' nur das gute Haze mit
Die Schlampen rufen an

Die Ampel wird rot und ich drück', drück'
Pumpe das Schrot und ich drück', drück'
Hantel aus Chrom, ich drück', drück'
Drück' Ott, das so klebt wie ein Prittstift
Schwarz oder rot, ich drück', drück'
Fahr' mich noch tot, weil ich drück', drück'
Die Schlampe schreit „Oh!“, wenn ich drück', drück'

Drück, drück, drück, drück
Drück, drück, drück, drück
Ich hab' immer noch Raps für die Pusher (hah)
Streck' immer noch Dreck in das Pulver (immer noch)
Mach' immer noch Geld mit Amnezia-Haze
Drei Oll'n im Hotel, wenn ich Druck hab' (hah)
Eine, die kocht, eine, die lutscht
Eine putzt von der Rolex den Schmutz ab (ja)
Scheine im Kopf, keine Geduld
Gestrickt ausm einfachen Muster (wooh)
Abpacken, wegdrücken, raushol'n (hah)
Wir kenn'n das Geschäft von klein auf schon
Kann sein, dass passiert, wenn du aufmuckst
Du leider verwirrt in den Lauf guckst
Es geht um Ketten, Uhren, Autos
Mach bitte dein Handy auf lautlos (schhh)
Sechste Etage wächst 'ne Plantage
Ich zieh' das Gewächs jetzt im Haus hoch (wooh)
Fahr' E500 Brabus
Guck mal, die Felge, schamlos
Die Fotzen rufen an

Pumpe das Schrot und ich drück', drück'
Hantel aus Chrom, ich drück', drück'
Drück' Ott, das so klebt wie ein Prittstift

Kokain läuft und betäubt meine Kehle (yes)
Neuer Tag, es gibt neue Pakete (ah)
Früher noch arm, mache heute Karriere (ja)
Hast nicht gezahlt, das wird heute erledigt
Ich drück' dir den Colt an die Schläfe
Auch wenn der Staatsanwalt hinter mir her ist
Fans drücken weiter bei Insta aufs Herz
Scheiß auf die Bull'n, meine Jungs machen Welle (wooh)
Und geh' ich in Bau, mach' ich Push-Up in Zelle (zack)
Hab' immer Hunger, muss essen
Das heißt, Menschen unter Druck setzen

Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Uh, cut the top off, call it Amber Rose
Just bought a big body, time to paint the toes
Known to act a donkey on the camel-toe
Then take the camel-toe and turn it into casserole
2 Chainz talkin' on the flake's phone
Poof! Just like that the whole check gone
Former posterpedic I was slept on
So many chains on it look like my neck gone
My girl came through and brought an extra body
Now that's an after party for the after party
Two-gun game, all black ferrari
His and her Armani, put it in a tonic
And yeah, the bread good if the head good
Before benihana's it was canned goods
Before canned goods it was similac
I'm from where they send sharks then we send 'em back
A half a million dollars worth of crack money
Wrap your parents up, now you got a black mommy
Yeah I did it, true to my religion
Two guns on me, fuck with extensions
If you on the pole, play your position
I got enough dough to pay your tuition
Corduroy trues, with the skull cap
I just woke up, tell me where the drugs at
And after the drugs, where the girls at
And after the guns, where the love at
And if it ain't no love, I'm like fuck that
Nigga I'm so dope, you could catch a fuckin' contact
Good weed, bad bitch
Got these hoes on my dick like Brad Pitt
Woah, I seen it all before
The bitch got a man, but she schemin' on the low
How it go? It go, fuck them other niggas cause I'm down for my niggas
My homies got the ?, automatics no clickers
Huh? Codine, no liquor
Man, life is a bitch, mine is a gold digger
I'm fucked, let's fuck
She said she on her period, I said, "Yuck"
I called another bopper, I beat it like a copper
Two big chain, one big chopper, bitch
I got the chopper for the cold response
The codine got me standin' horizontal
I had enough of the broken promises
So I'm in a room full of Pocahontases
And this shit is of the meat rack
Weed sack, big car, layin' with my seat back
We next, weed never left Holland, weed bag
All this ice on my and my niggas playing freeze tag
Lord forgive me, this my fourth foreign
If you baby daddy lame, you should forewarn him
I come through with the yapper on
Turn that nigga into hot bologna
I'm the type a nigga cop a rolly, cop a benz, cop a two
Then wear it all to Church, nigga Hallelu
Uh, I'm from the trap where the block'll pay you
Me and my nigga pass your ho like a hot potato
I be like you could get her, he be like you could get her
I be like you could have her, he be like you could have her
He be like, it don't matter, I be like, me neitherr
Uh, my old school got twenty-sixes on it
And I got you girl kissin' on me
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!
Yuck Daddy! Yuck!

Welcome to my world of hurt, where I put in work
I got guns that knock you off of this earth
Stand up let yourself be heard, I ain't hear one word
I'm just bringing through what the crowd deserves
Cause what you want that's what we got
Once things begin, my nigga it won't stop
Lock down your blocks lets flood the streets
Now welcome to the world of Mr. X to the Z
Motherfucker I'm
Back with a vengeance, back with the business
I'm a vet with a pension, a man with a vision
I'm a man on a mission, so crowd around listen
This that hardcore heavy head bang, you've been missing
Go to Defcon one, if you don't comply
I might explode like a meth lab, there is no rehab
Bitches need knee-pads, a pound of some Zig Zags
That last like Etta James, I'm back let the cage rap
Charles Bronson, visionary marksman
Heartless, leave your intellect on your carpet
I don't really start shit, I just like to finish it
dismember with a hacksaw, getting rid of it
I'm so militant, you so Gilligan, killing it
Heard you want the coast on your back
Yo, be careful what you wish for, good luck with that
You could be found in your trunk, with your chest collapsed, relax
Welcome to my world of hurt, where I put in work
I got guns that knock you off of this earth
Stand up let yourself be heard, I ain't hear one word
I'm just bringing through what the crowd deserves
Cause what you want that's what we got
Once things begin, my nigga it won't stop
Lock down your blocks lets flood the streets
Now welcome to the world of Mr. X to the Z
Motherfucker I'm
Made for the masses, chromed out classics
Block after block, when I park so Jurassic
Cameras start flashing, everybody asking
Harassing, suck my dick with six aspirins
That'll keep your head tight, back from the afterlife
Locked in my hurt locker, built up my appetite
You need your name in lights, when I just need a mic
And I can level any playing field, like a sheet of ice
It's going down like when you cuffed, and they read your rights
I'm going higher, better bail, if you're scared of heights
I'm ritual killing prepare for a sacrifice
Roll her like a pair a' dice, lounging in paradise
Jealous niggas want to feed, like a parasite
Burn leeches off with cigarettes, I just need a light
I been around, seen the press get it shut down
I'm stadium status, the crowd got to move NOW!!!
Welcome to my world of hurt, where I put in work
I got guns that knock you off of this earth
Stand up let yourself be heard, I ain't hear one word
I'm just bringing through what the crowd deserves
Cause what you want that's what we got
Once things begin, my nigga it won't stop
Lock down your blocks lets flood the streets
Now welcome to the world of Mr. X to the Z
Motherfucker I'm
A man dies once, a coward dies a thousand times
Your bitch asses on nine hundred and ninety nine
You only got one more, you better make it last
Before a lay this hurt locker to your fucking ass
Lock chop choppers, chop shop droppers
Fresh state to state until the feds came knocking
Call us in the clutch when your shows ain't popping
When your hoes ain't dropping, when your flows ain't rocking
Welcome to my world of hurt, where I put in work
I got guns that knock you off of this earth
Stand up let yourself be heard, I ain't hear one word
I'm just bringing through what the crowd deserves
Cause what you want that's what we got
Once things begin, my nigga it won't stop
Lock down your blocks lets flood the streets
Now welcome to the world of Mr. X to the Z
Motherfucker I'm
... bottle of claret for you if I'd realised. I'd forgotten all about it, George, I'm sorry
Well, do next time
Will you forgive me?
Mmmm...yes..
Cheeky bitch
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number..
...Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
...About the stortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by they'd
Get a little bit older and a little bit slower but..
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by
Someone who's always umpteen (...)
Your father's giving it diddly-i-dee district was leaving..
Intended to die (...) Ottoman..
I've got to say irritably and..
There was not really enough light to get down
And ultimately (...) Slumped down
Suddenly..
They may stop the funding..
Place your bets
The original
Afraid she'll die (...)
Great colours for the season
Number nine, number nine
Who's to know?
Who was to know?
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
I sustained nothing worse than (...)
Also, for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night, when fortune gives..
Be alright, be alright
Right, right, right, right
Right
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Ri-i-i-i-ight
Ri-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-ight
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
It makes me a few day's late
Compared with, like, wow!
And wierd stuff like that..
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha..
Nine, number nine
They are standing still
The plan, the telegram..
(Hubbbbba, hubbbbba, hubbbbbba, hubbbbba, hubbbbba
Number nine, number Hubbba)
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to my son
He really can try, as they do, to find function..
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low..
Alright!
It was on fire and his glasses were the same
This thing know if it was tinted
But you know it isn't
To me it is..
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine, number nine
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
to price it (...) Yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see a dentist instead
That gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the fucking navy and went to sea
Block that kick, block that kick
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Bird's for birding, and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whemming
...Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Number nine, number nine, number nine, number nine
Number nine, number nine
Industry allows financial imbalance
Thrusting it bewteen his shoulder blades
The watusi, the twist
Eldorado
Take this, brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
What, what oh..
Maybe, even then, impervious in London
...Could be difficult thing..
It's quick like rush for peace because it's so much
Like being naked
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright
It's alright
If, you've become naked
Block that kick, block that kick, block that kick, block that kick
Block that kick, block that kick, block that kick, block that kick
Block that kick, block that kick, block that kick, block that kick
Block that kick, block that kick, block that kick, block that nixon

"A Taste of Honey"
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Tu du tu du
Tu du tu du
I dream of your 
First kiss and then
I feel 
upon my lips again
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return
Yes I will return
I'll come back 
For the honey 
And you
Tu du tu du
Tu du tu du
Yours was 
A kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still 
Though we're far apart
That taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return
Yes I will return
I'll come back 
For the honey 
And you
Well, if your hands start a-clappin' 
And your fingers start a-poppin' 
And your feet start a-movin' around 
And if you start to swing and sway 
When the band starts to play 
A real cool way out sound 
And if you get to can't help it and you can't sit down 
You feel like you gotta move around 
You get a shot of rhythm and blues. 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure. 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes
Well, with your lover by your side 
Don't you know you're gonna have a rockin' time, c'mon! 
Don't you worry 'bout a thing 
If you start to dance and sing 
And chills come up on you 
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too 
Well, here's thing for you to do 
Get a shot of rhythm and blues 
With just a little rock and roll on the side 
Just for good measure 
Get a pair of dancin' shoes

If the rain comes they run and hide their heads.
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes,
If the rain comes.
When the sun shines, they slip into the shade
And sip their lemonade
When the sun shines,
When the sun shines.
Rain, I don't mind,
Shine, the weather's fine.
I can show you that when it starts to rain
When the rain comes down,
Everything's the same
When the rain comes down,
I can show you,
I can show you.
Rain, I don't mind,
Shine, the weather's fine.
Can you hear me that when it rains
And shines it's just a state of mind
Can you hear me,
Can you hear me?
Rodney Burke: Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
John: It's from the form upper third at Hemmel Homestead, it says:
Rodney: Oh!
John: It says, 'Dear Geroge, John, Ringo, Paul
here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice
we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool
so, brighten up our lads at school.'
Dig this, for here's Paul,  whistling 'Clarabella'.

This whip is built for queens, and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (my box Chevy!)
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin low to the side I lean

Fuck a limousine, I'd rather ride Caprices
My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us
Ridin 85 northbound shakin doors down 
so I turn the speakers louder pissin off polices
Fuck a five-star chick, got a porn star bitch

Now she goin down on me givin road head
bustin on her forehead then I took her back to the homestead
Peace~! Back in the Caprice
Took a sack of weed and crumbled it inside a Cognac blunt wrap
Now it's time to jump back on the highway 85 
slumpin in my seat like I'm hunchback
And my Chevy lookin so dope
Old school Vogues on it got it floatin like a row boat
Gold flakes in the candy paint drippin on the road
drivin slow like a motherfuckin show boat
Hoe don't act like you don't hear me comin
I got the Willis drummin and it's comin out the clarion
12's in the trunk, flat screen TV's 
in the headrest with "Something About Mary" on

Pick a bitch like I pick the piccolo, go anywhere you wanna go, pick a road
Interstate 59, 20, 75, 285, 85 southbound
Twin pipes like pow-pow, hundred spokes on the Vogues like wow, wow, wow
Bang, pop, pop, this thing go pow
Dolce crop top, my play close down
Those Céline wedges are way downtown
Best dressed up, better, you best dressed down
Oh, it's me, fella, the banji gets out
All females fledge to bambi style
Light my wrist up, flex and glow
Vamp me up, turn her down
Amp me up, sugar, it's like mm-ow
Got the good-good, the yum-yum, wow
Oh, it's so supple—the ass so round
Trust, there's no trouble, the king go down
Bust your bitch bubble, where's my crown
Banks, flame hot, Rapunzel style
Bang, pop, pop, this thing go pow
Bang, pop, pop, this thing go pow
If she ain't know, the bitch know now
It's the one, miss, the cunt is out
Flip the scripts, so your bitch

Bang, pop, pop, this thing go pow
Bang, pop, pop, this thing go pow
If she ain't know, the bitch know now
If she ain't know, the bitch know now

Boy (boy), your friends will laugh at you now, now, now
In that, you been did that, you been with that, you been-been that, bitch
But they all forget you when I spin this shit
Better dance for this and get your skin wet, bitch
Its the Champ to sip, the cinnamon, young hip
Making plans to get your little bammer's dick
If she ain't legit you better send that witch
If the mens is rich, you better spend that chip
Better put that M-B, get that, get that banji
Bitch, you know you never looking pretty princey
Pretty princey, pretty pretty princey
Bitches on the cover look at pretty AB
Pretty AB, pretty pretty AB

I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out 
When you're face to face with your adversity 
I really know how it feels to be, stressed out, stressed out 
We're gonna make this thing work out eventually 
1: Consequence, Q-Tip 
Yo I ain't one to complain but there's things in the game 
Don't stress that 'cause it's not in your bloodstream 
Your whole being, comes from greatness, d'you remember 
Shatan got you caught in the storms of December 
And brothers on the block packin nines like September 
Crazy situations keeps pockets on slender 
Yo I be on the avenue where they be actin brand new 
I'm splurgin' on these Reebok joints for shorty boo 
All of a sudden, I saw these two kids frontin 
Talkin out they joints but they wasn't sayin' nuttin 
My hand was on my toolie they was actin unruly 
But I swallowed my pride and let that nonsense ride 
Because I'm positive it seems that negative dies 
Yo we was at the dice game makin these cats look silly 
Flamin, steady runnin off at the Willie 
I had my cash mixed, my rent due, with my play-dough 
I gotta see some loot so all my girls I blow 
Shook them shits in my palm let em hit the flo? 
Kept my eyeballs scopin for them pigs po-po 
I got to go on the ave see my parole by fo? 
But I gotta steady freak these boys like JoJo 
And I was doin' it, 'til I met Ike, Spike, and Mike 
One roll, they had my pockets thirstier than Sprite 
Yo I know the feelin, when you feelin like a villain 
You be havin good thoughts but the evils be revealin 
and the stresses of life can take you off the right path (no doubt) 
Jealousy and envy tends to infiltrate your staff 
We gotta hold it down so we can move on past 
all adversities, so we can get through fast, like that 
R
2: Consequence 
You got the N.W.O. (low cash flow) 
Your baby's on the way (and you don't know who) 
And crosstown niggaz tryin to (bust at you) 
Aiyyo they got me stressed out (and you don't know what to do) 
So frame this Kodak black, and vision to my contact 
with a poultry scrap, workers get pistol smacked 
The switch hittin Queens, niggaz liquid sword spittin 
with raw poppy, and now your first love is krill 
Your vision of the mil got crept like Hey Lover 
Tried to rise to the top, you just couldn't recover 
And all I want is my laceration of the pie 
to get this whip cream before the water runs dry 
Niggaz flashdancin yo I don't know why 
You?re sick of snitchin, she got you cruisin to the pokey 
like Smokey, the stress be tryin to squeeze out a homey 
While I be tryin to get star status like Shinobi 
So we can build a dynasty, just like the Toby's 
And all I want, is the world to know my steez 
These money hungry niggaz is seven thirty 
And got me stressed out like these frog MC's 
R

I'm going out with a crash
Tear it up with my past
If you want it Bring the ruckus Turn it up a notch
You want to see me burn, 
But burning up your barns and vermin
I'm busting verses and rehearsing for your burial
I'm doing cartwheels and aerials
Get out my way before I bury you
Carry you, out of my face is the scenario
Telling you to come and bring the ruckus
You can try but you won't take me down
I'm standing on my ground
As all the fear inside me fades away
You can try to get a reaction
But you're no distraction to me
Bring the ruckus to me, bring the ruckus, 
Bring the ruckus to me, Bring the Ruckus
This ain't the first or the last
I'm pistol-whipping the track
If you want it, come and get it
You can't walk my path
I'm burning wholes in you, better run
When you gonna learn
Loaded weapons unloading on you
With every word
Shake you down into a misery, history
Know my enemy you're not a friend of me fade away
Forever my time, all stars shine
Telling you to come and BRING THE RUCKUS
You can try but you won't take me down
I'm standing on my ground
As all the fear inside me fades away
You can try to get a reaction
But you're no distraction to me
Bring the ruckus to me!!!!!!!!!!
Bring it on I will be your enemy
Head strong you don't want to fight with me
Bring it on I will be your enemy
Head strong you don't want to fight with me
Bring it on I will be your enemy
Head strong you don't want to fight with me
Bring it on I will be your enemy
Head strong you don't want to fight with me
You can try but you won't take me down
I'm standing on my ground
As all the fear inside me fades away
You can try to get a reaction
But you're no distraction to me
Bring the ruckus to me!!!!!!!!!!
Nahh no, nahh nahh fuck that
Niggas think cause you fuckin' made Chum and got all personal
That niggas won't go back to that old fuckin' 2010 shit
About talkin' 'bout fuckin' everything all
No fuck that nigga I got you
Fuck that
Grab mittens who have to spit blizzardous
Actually flick cigarette ash at bitch niggas
Harassment, eight nickels of hash, delay quick, and then dash
To Saint Nicholas pad to taste venison
Still in the business of smacking up little rappers with
Raquets you play tennis with, hated for bank lifting and
Spraying then hide away in the shade of his maimed innocence
Suitcase scented with haze and fileted sentences
Advanced apathy, smashing the man cameras up
Tan khakis, an antagonist Dan-dappered up
Vagabond, had it since a Padawan
Rapping hot as fucking cattle brands wearing flannel thongs
Grab a bong, momma and some food, beer, tag along
Get a nice spanking, new Sears catalog
Send them nettled critics to the bezzle stop, dead and wrong
Get 'em higher than the pitch of metal tea kettle songs
Four deep in a Rover cannon
Riding dirty through a Saugus canyon, niggas know that it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
50 K for the last check
But the Dollar Menu still be on deck
Nigga its the motherfuckin'
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Yeah, the Misadventures of a shit-talker
Pissed as Rick Ross's fifth sip off his sixth lager
Known to sit and wash the sins off at the pitch alter
Hat never backwards like the print off legit manga
Get it? Like a blue pill, make ya stick longer
Or a swift fist off your chin from his wrist launcher
Chick, chronic thrift shopper, thick like the Knicks roster
Stormed off and came straight back like fixed posture
Pen? Naw, probably written with some used syringes
From out the rubbish bin at your local loony clinic
Watching movies in a room full of goons he rented
On the hunt for clues, more food, and some floozy women
Bruising gimmicks with the broom he usually use for Quidditch
Gooey writtens, scoot 'em to a ditch, chewed and booty scented
Too pretentious, do pretend like he could lose to spitting
Steaming tubes of poop and twisted doobies full of euphemisms
Stupid, thought it up, jot it quick
Thought out, toss it right back like a vodka fifth
Spot him on a rocket swapping dollars in for pocket lint
Then lob a wad of chicken at a copper on some Flocka shit
Posing nigga try to disrespect
Get a fucking thunder to his neck, shout out to Nak, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
Looking bummy, posted on the block, looking like I ain't make
A quarter million off of socks, nigga, cause it's the
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G
G-O-L-F-dub-A-N-G

And I have the man dem stutterin’
I’m getting this nigga in the morning
He gon’ think he been chiefin just too long when
He see me in the evenin’
Want to catch all these feelin
Well let me be the first to get mine
Ay yo, ay yo, barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sittin’and countin’, smoking a spliff, this shit’s a gift
All my niggas watches is rough
Grabbing our crotches yelling ‘’What up?’’
The jeans cost $500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see, the smell it’s a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won’t feel your legs kid
I’m a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yellin’ Chef, kill the plate with the cooks
I say ‘Ye with 2 Chainz on, we Common, let’s Push
Burn another bush, then burn another we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock I’m all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock yo?
I was born by a late chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Golly, I know she wanna test the ‘Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryin’ to see through the mist of it
Could have been livin’ it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development
Situation delicate
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All cause his pockets now knotty as his hair
Yeah
All Sonny no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up so its
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
In God we trust, the game is all us
Til’ the sky calls or its flames on us
Push
2 Chainz
I’m chillin’ in my camo, flippin’ through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo’s a Lambo (damn)
Four doors of ammo
Ammunition I’m pitchin’ to make your body switch another position
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
Its tickelin’ when I hear what haters be whisperin’
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Fake friends and siblings, like to wish you well but ain’t never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can’t spell war without an A-R
15 I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21 they said I’d be inside a graveyard
Can’t wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?
Yeah, you feelin’ on top now, getting that money nigga?
(Naw man, mad people was frontin’
Aw man, made something from nothing)
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. would’ve been God except I added more o’s
If I knew she was cheatin’ I’d still’ve bought her more clothes
‘Cause I was too busy with my Baltimore- you know
Some people call that the art of war you know
I guess it depends what you fallin’ for
The clothes, cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aw money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was frontin’
God damn, we made something from nothing
You know it ain't no stoppin all tha doggs I'm droppin
It's Friday night so everythang is poppin
I gots ten to spend on the Hen
So let tha games begin
Yakity yak don't jump back or its on
Callin up Earl on tha car phone
Mack 10 just got out of court
Rollin through tha hood 
In his super sport bumpin Too $hort
Eighteens got tha rearview mirrors vibratin
And deep dish daytons
You know how we do it

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
Cos I'm happy just to dance with you
If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Cos I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Cos I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
If I fell in love with you
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared,
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book,
I'd love to turn you on...
Woke up, got out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all,
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on...
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan?
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been workin' like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleepin' like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel all right
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home 
Everything seems to be right
When I'm home 
Feeling you holding me tight
Tight, yeah
It's been a hard day's night
And I've been working like a dog
It's been a hard day's night
I should be sleeping like a log
But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright.
You know I feel all right
You know I feel all right
"Ask Me Why"
I love you
Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true 
That it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine
My happiness still makes me cry
And in time
You'll understand the reason why
If I cry
It's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I love you
Cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true 
That it really only goes to show
That I know
That I, I, I, I 
Should never, never, never be blue
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you, you, you
